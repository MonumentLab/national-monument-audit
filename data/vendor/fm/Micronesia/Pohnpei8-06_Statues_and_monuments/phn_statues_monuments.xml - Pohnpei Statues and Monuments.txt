  Description:
    Abstract: This dataset shows the locations of statues and monuments on Pohnpei. The data layer was formatted for GIS by Island Research & Education Initiative (iREi) (2017), using KML files created by Alex Zuccarelli for Pohnpei Eco-Adventure Map Guide Series (2013). An additional site was added by iREi.
    Purpose: To show the locations of statues and monuments on Pohnpei.
    Supplemental_Information: The dataset is included the Digital Atlas of Micronesia, module Pohnpei, by Island Research & Education Initiative (iREi), in collaboration with Water and Environmental Research Institute of the Western Pacific (WERI) University of Guam and partial funding from United States Geological Survey (USGS), under WRRI 104-B Program, project # 2016GU302B.
