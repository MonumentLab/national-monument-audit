They are larger than a house mouse and have white feet, larger ears and a long tail that is light underneath and dark above. They use their internal cheek pouches to carry seeds from grasses, grains, and berries to their burrows, These mice are active all winter and are an important food source for owls, hawks, coyotes and other predators.  The tiny Least Chipmunk scurrying along fallen logs is one of the most commonly seen chipmunks in the Rockies.  This chipmunk spends its time on the ground where it buries food and digs small well-hidden entrances to their extensive tunnels. These rodents love to eat berries, nuts, seeds, mushrooms and even insects.  Racoons are seen along the rivers and valleys of Wyoming. Usually nocturnal, Racoons are active year round. They are omnivores, eating just about anything.  They consume a large amount of food in the fall to build up a fat reserve to sustain them through the winter. They often have dens in hollow trees such as dead cottonwoods.  The Mountain Cottontail (also called Nuttail’s Cottontail) spends most of its day sitting quietly in dug-out depressions called “forms” beneath thick vegetation or under rocks or buildings. When dusk comes they venture out to graze on vegetation, always just a short leap from cover. Even though these rabbits look cute, they are quite tough, able to survive in a harsh landscape full of predators. These rabbits have an incredible reproduction rate: four to five litters, averaging five young each are possible in a year. Most of the young don’t survive the year falling prey to hawks, weasels, coyotes and other predators.  The industries beaver is one of nature’s marvels. Building large, elaborate dams and lodges, the beaver creates pond that becomes habitat for many other animals.  Most of the wood cutting and dam building occurs at night, but beaver can be seen in the day sunning themselves, but they quickly dive under the water with a loud splat of their tail to warn other beaver if they see you. Beaver are extremely strong for their size. They can handle and drag a 20 pound piece of wood with their jaws.

The upper tributaries of the river – the Roaring Fork, Stough Creek, Deep Creek and Tayo Creek are fed by many alpine lakes. A watershed, or drainage basin, is the entire land area that channels water via streams, lakes and rivers to major rivers and ultimately the sea. When water runs over this watershed, it picks up sediments and other dissolved substances, indluding pollutants, from the land. This relationship between land and water is critical because it affects water quality. Unpolluted land is vital in providing clean water. Snow and rain falling over 190 square miles flows into the Middle Fork watershed and since much of this land is a protected wilderness area, the water flowing into the Popo Agie River is pure. It supports a wide variety of plants and wildlife as well as provides clean water for people.  Most of the water running in the Popo Agie comes from snow fields high in the Wind River Mountains. These Mountains get enough snow to support active glaciers. Some years the high peaks can receive 200 inches of snow.

The government ordered the removal of all persons of Japanese ancestry and the War Relocation Authority was established in March 1942 to house them in inland camps. The Heart Mountain Relocation Center was one of ten temporary camps constructed to confine over 110,000 men, women and children forced to leave their homes in California, Oregon, Washington and part of Arizona. It was the only camp located in Wyoming. Construction on the center began in June 1942 and the first internees arrived in August of that year. At the peak of its population the Heart Mountain Center, which covered over 740 acres, contained nearly 11,000 people housed in 450 barracks. Although surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards, the internees kept the camp functioning as a small city with its own public works, grade schools, a high school, hospital and newspaper. At the time it was the third largest city in Wyoming.  The camp was closed in November 1945, the buildings removed and the land, made arable by irrigation ditches completed by the internees, was opened up for homesteading.  A portion of the Heart Mountain Center was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 19, 1985.

There was little protection from the elements in a coach and, depending on the season and the weather, heat, cold, rain, dust, and insects in the cabin were to be expected. To keep warm in the winter, passengers wore buffalo coats or covered themselves with buffalo hides provided by the stageline.  Setting aside the hardships, the one thing stagecoach travel did provide was beautiful scenery and adventure.  In 1866, U.S. Congressmen Demas Barnes spoke about his cross-country stagecoach journey: “Coaches will be overloaded, it will rain, the dust will drive, the baggage will be left to the storm, passengers will get sick… children will cry, passengers will get angry, drivers will swear, the sensitive will shrink, rations will give out… and the dirt almost always unendurable.”","LAT_1":41.67663,"LON_1":-108.79161,"LAT_2":41.6766,"LON_2":-108.7916,"Location":"41.6766, -108.7916","Location_X":-108.7916,"Location_Y":41.6766,"COUNTY":"Sweetwater","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49826488737_8787ff7f95_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":215,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12054833.0763558,5249058.16691949]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":215,"FID":535,"MAMID":"FR0055.09","SIGNNAME":"Beaver Rim and Wind River Range","LEGEND":"Viewed from Beaver Rim, the Wind River Mountains, part of the Rocky Mountain chain, boast 53 granite peaks over 13,000 feet high.

An important landmark, Pilot Butte served as a guide post separating South Pass trails from the more southerly Overland Trail that crossed southern Wyoming. Oddly enough, Pilot Butte was more important to travelers headed east than it was for west-bound emigrants.  The name Pilot Butte appears on fur trade maps at least as early as 1837. Captain Howard Stansbury mentioned Pilot Butte on September 12, 1850, as his column of Topographic engineers travelled east from Fort Bridger guided by Jim Bridger. Stansbury’s journal reads, “…we came in sight of a high butte, situated on the eastern side of the Green River, some forty miles distant: a landmark well known to the traders, and called by them Pilot Butte.”  The butte grew in importance as a landmark as traffic eastward increased in the 1850s and especially in 1862 when Ben Holladay moved his stagecoach and freighting operations from the Oregon Trail south to the Overland route.  Interestingly, the butte sits atop White Mountain and is just north of the original location of the Rock Springs airport. Thus, Pilot Butte was used as a landmark by early-day pilots – flying the first airmail routes across the nation.

That all changed when the nation’s uranium industry boomed after World War II.  In the early 1950’s, prospectors started combing Wyoming’s hills for surefire riches. Then, in 1954  prospector Robert (Bob) Adams discovered uranium. He founded the Lost Creek Oil and Uranium Company, purchased property next to Home on the Range and built a company town, naming it Jeffrey City after Dr. C.W. Jeffrey of Rawlins, his biggest financial baker. Adams renamed his company Western Nuclear, Inc. and later sold to Phelps-Dodge, a mining conglomerate, during the industry’s slowdown in the 1960s. With the next uranium boom in the 1970s, Phelps-Dodge added employees and built housing, streets, and parks; Jeffrey City bustled. In 1980, with nearby uranium mines in full swing, over 4,000 people called Jeffrey City home. The school had almost 600 students, and the area’s uranium industry employed nearly 1,000 workers. The town’s existence revolved around the uranium industry.  Then came the bust in the early 1980s – and when uranium busted, Jeffrey City faded away. By 1982 only 1,000 people remained.

Brooks, William C. Ervine, and J.B. Kendrick, future Wyoming U.S. senator and governor, later consolidated it. Mining began to decline in the early 1920s and by the 1930s, the small amount of coal still mined in the area was primarily for local use. Monarch was formally abandoned in 1953, and all that remains today are a few livestock structures, town water tower, St. Thomas Catholic Church, and the mine foreman’s house.  A DANGEROUS JOB All aspects of a miner’s job proved dangerous. Miners dug tunnels into the coal vein and opened individual “rooms” at right angles off of the main tunnel. Miners worked in pairs to dig out the coal. The first miner used his pick to undercut the wall of coal while the second loaded coal into a coal car. Then they blasted the face and removed the chunks of fallen coal.  MINING TRAGEDIES From 1911-1926, the height of mining in the Sheridan area, approximately 650 miners died in Wyoming. Mine explosions, inhalation of toxic gases, and crushing by mine collapse and coal car caused these fatal accidents.  Two miners died in an explosion in one of the worse accidents in this region in the Dietz Mine NO. 8 on June 4, 1919. Compounding the tragedy, one of the miners, Bob Gault, had traded his usual shift with another miner in order to attend his daughter’s wedding the next day.  TO THE BOYS OF THE RESCUE CREW From the Wyoming State Mine Inspector’s 1921 Report. When the damp explodes in a distant room, Or the roof of an entry falls, Sealing the men in a living tomb With the thick and soundless walls, When the women crowd at the open slope And wail as the women do, It’s then we call for the nerve and craft Of the Boys of the Rescue Crew. They take the smoke, As a sort of joke; They dare the fire damp too; For it’s all their trade, And they’re not afraid, The Boys of the Rescue Crew.  WYOMING’S 1886 COAL MINE SAFETY ACT This Act made Wyoming Territory a leader in improving mining conditions. As well as implementing safety codes, the law prohibited boys under 14 and all females from being in or around the mines.

The town was completed in 1925. \nThe motif for Parco’s architecture is Spanish Colonial, featuring tile roofs, stucco exteriors and iron balconies. The sixty-room Parco Inn, which opened for business on May 31, 1925, spans an entire town block and features two five story bell towers. Single story wings extend from both sides of the hotel to house shops and other businesses. A long arched vestibule leads to the tiled main lobby, where wrought iron balconies on the second floor overlook the lobby below. Twin stairways lead to the upper floors. Exposed hand-painted cedar beams, featuring stencils designed by Thomas Arrak of Denver, support stained glass skylights. Other notable architectural details include arched colonnades, impost moldings, dentiled string cornices, neo-baroque spiraled columns, a ballroom and a large fireplace. Although guests could dine in the Inn’s coffee shop, the Parco Inn was most noted for its famous Fountain Room restaurant. Live trout were stocked in the pool of the Fountain Room and guests could order the freshest fish in Wyoming. Parco fell on hard times during the Great Depression and in 1934 the town site, refinery and oil fields were sold to Harry Sinclair’s Consolidated Oil, later named the Sinclair Refining Company. The town’s name was changed to Sinclair in 1942. In 1967, the Sinclair Refinery Company sold most of the town site to local residents and the Parco Inn has been under private ownership since that time.","LAT_1":41.77900393,"LON_1":-107.1150537,"LAT_2":41.779,"LON_2":-107.115,"Location":"41.7790, -107.1150","Location_X":-107.115,"Location_Y":41.779,"COUNTY":"Carbon","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464765587_a2eccbe302_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":825,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12226341.8469664,5295351.76531725]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":825,"FID":717,"MAMID":"SU0023.96","SIGNNAME":"Naming of a Lake","LEGEND":"Sir William Drummond Stewart of Scotland can be called Wyoming’s first tourist.

Four of those gatherings took place nearby, at the confluence of Horse Creek and the Green River. This magnificent glacier-carved lake must have been one of Stewart’s favorite spots. Artist Alfred Jacob Miller accompanied Stewart in 1837 and painted the first pictures of the area, including the mountain lakes that inspired both men. Although the last rendezvous was held in 1840, Stewart and mountain man William Sublette returned one more time in 1843. They camped here for 10 days in August, visited old Shoshone Indian and trapper friends, and raced horses on a flat to the west near the New Fork River. Stewart and a small party floated to the head of the lake in an India-rubber boat brought especially for that purpose.  At that time this lake was called both Stewart’s Lake and Loch Drummond. The year before, in 1842, explorer John C. Fremont had made his first trip west, and guided by Kit Carson, climbed what he thought was the highest summit in the Wind River Mountains. This peak, which towers over the lake, was later named Fremont’s Peak.  Long after, not knowing that the lake had already been named in honor of Stewart, Fremont supporters named it Fremont Lake even though John C.

A rearing station does not have the capabilities to hatch eggs. A rearing station only receives fish after they reach fingerling size (about 2-inches long). They are raised at the rearing station until they are ready to be stocked.  What kind of fish do you raise? At the Wigwam Fish Hatchery rainbow trout and Colorado river cutthroat trout are raised.  How many fish do you raise and stock in one year? Over a one-year period, Wigwam stocks around 300,000 trout with a total weight of approximately 30,000 pounds.  How big are the trout when you stock them? Fish stocked range from 3- to 9-inches depending on the location. Ideally, trout are stocked small and grow to sizes acceptable to anglers in the wild. But some waters have predatory fish or other factors that mandate a larger fish (around 9-inches) to insure their survival.  When are fish stocked? Fish are generally stocked throughout the open water period, late March through November. Depending on the type of fishery the trout are destined for, fish may be stocked in areas only once a year or several times throughout the year.  Where does Wigwam stock fish? Rainbow trout from this hatchery could be stocked anywhere throughout the state including large reservoirs, streams, and hhig mountain lakes. The Colorado River cutthrout trout are all stocked into their historic range of the Little Snake River drainage in south-central Wyoming.  How do you determine where to stock fish? Local fisheries managers determine the size, species (kind of fish), time of year, and where to stock trout. They study many factors like habitat suitability, food availablity, presence/absence of predatory fish, and angler needs just to name a few.  What is the survival rate of stocked fish? The survival rate of stocked fish depends on the fishery where they are stocked. Factors that can affect survival are the presence/absence of predators, water quality, habitat suitability, angler harvest, and the size of the fish stocked.  Where are the “BIG” fish? They are kept inside the broodhouse.  How is the fish hatchery funded? The Wyoming Game and Fish Department is funded through the sales of hunting and fishing licenses. A small portion of the money also comes from a federal excise tax on fishing and hunting equipment.  How many eggs does a typical trout lay? At Wigwam, a Colorado River cutthroat trout produces 800 to 1,100 eggs once per year.  How long does it take to raise an 8-inch trout? Trout at Wigwam grow at a rate of ¼ of an inch per month. So, it takes about 12 months to grow an 8-inch trout.  Do you sell any fish? No. All the fish that you see at the hatchery will be stocked somewhere in Wyoming. Hunters and anglers pay for them through license fees so all the fish are stocked into public waters.  Do you raise warmwater fish such as walleye, bass, and bluegill? No. We trade some of Wyoming’s trout eggs and fish to other states. In return we receive the warmwater fish that are required to maintain that type of fishery.  How many fish hatcheries and rearing stations are there in Wyoming? There are currently ten stations operated by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department throughout the state.","LAT_1":44.064996,"LON_1":-107.380974,"LAT_2":44.0649,"LON_2":-107.3809,"Location":"44.0649, -107.3809","Location_X":-107.3809,"Location_Y":44.0649,"COUNTY":"Washakie","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50188873952_30988ae2fc_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":762,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11910379.550635,5571135.55315591]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":762,"FID":1071,"MAMID":"SH0003.92","SIGNNAME":"Bozeman Trail Marker - Big Horn","LEGEND":"Bozeman Trail marked by the State of Wyoming 1914.","LAT_1":44.67905222,"LON_1":-106.9927599,"LAT_2":44.679,"LON_2":-106.9927,"Location":"44.6790, -106.9927","Location_X":-106.9927,"Location_Y":44.679,"COUNTY":"Sheridan","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464549051_f275aa860b_z.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":816,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12246604.0537013,5346595.48583565]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":816,"FID":747,"MAMID":"SU0014.92","SIGNNAME":"Green River Tie Drive Information Sign","LEGEND":"FIRST TIE DRIVE ON GREEN RIVER  Because timber was scarce in neighboring states along the first transcontinental railroad line, the tie business flourished here and in other Wyoming mountain locations. Ties were cut in winter, stored on the river bank until spring, and floated downstream during high water. Charles DeLoney was a youthful Michigan Civil War veteran who came to Wyoming after the war. An experienced timberman, he contracted with the Union Pacific Railroad in 1867 to supply ties. A crew of 30 men hauled equipment and supplies upriver and constructed a combined office-bunkhouse-cookshack-commissary building between this marker and the river. Cabins were built high in the timber, forcing the men to snowshoe for meals. DeLoney's was the first tie drive down the river, a trip of 130 miles. Ties were skidded down nearby hills and held by a boom across the river until the drive. Another boom at Green River City caught ties near the railhead. The operation continued successfully for two years, and newspaper advertisements as late as fall, 1868 solicited tie hacks to work at the head of the Green River. Charles DeLoney was a versatile person. He was a rancher, a pioneer merchant in Jackson and helped found the town of Evanston.

Tribes once used the land for hunting, but when the game was depleted, they no longer had a need for the area. In an agreement with James McLaughlin, U.S. Indian Inspector, the Arapaho and Shoshone received $60,000 in cattle, cash, and rations in exchange for the land. The following year, the State purchased one square mile of the property and created Big Horn Hot Springs State Reserve, the first state park in Wyoming.  Hot Springs State Park is known today for its colorful terraces and mineral hot springs. The terraces, primarily of gypsum and lime, gain their color from native algae. The waters, which flow at a rate of over 18,000 gallons every 24 hours, were once believed to have healing powers. Today, the waters are open to the public and maintained at a safe 104 degrees, instead of their natural 135 degrees.  Many individuals have utilized the therapeutic waters of the hot springs. In 1875, Dr. Thomas G. Maghee, famed pioneer of plastic surgery and the post surgeon at Camp Brown, visited the site and made note of the medicinal value of the mineral springs. While his tribe inhabited the land, Chief Washakie erected a personal bathhouse, which is remembered by a plaque found on the former site.  In addition to the mineral springs, Hot Springs State Park also contains picnic areas, boat ramps, and flower gardens.

Steep canyon walls display rocks of the Precambrian and Paleozoic eras ranging in age from several billion to 235 million years. The Wind River originally flowed across flat terrain beneath which lay the buried Owl Creek Mountains. These mountains formed 50 million years ago, as an upward fold in the earth’s crust, and were subsequently covered by younger sediment. About 4 million years ago a broad regional uplift of the earth’s crust resulted in the incision of the Wind River’s channel onto the rising crust, creating the canyon which cuts across the Owl Creek Mountains at a right angle. Rivers usually flow around or parallel to mountains, rather than across them. Sediment covering the Owl Creek Mountains was removed via erosion, resulting in development of the landscape you now view. The process continues.  Portions of the Canyon highway follow an ancient trail used by Native Americans, early fur trappers, traders, and U.S. Military expeditions. Native Americans, particularly the Shoshone, used this trail to reach the hot springs in present-day Thermopolis. William Ashley, “general” of the fur trade, floated a valuable cargo of pelts through the Canyon in 1825 on his way back to St. Louis.

The geologic feature rises a thousand feet above the surrounding plains. Granite rocks that range in age from 2.6 billion years  to 10 million years are exposed along its crest and slopes. The reddish rocks that comprise much of the distant hills are the Flathead Sandstone (Cambrian) which is 520 million years old. The grey strata that overlie the Flathead Sandstone are part of the Madison Limestone (Mississippian Period), a 360 million year old rock unit. Both the Flathead Sandstone and Madison Limestone were deposited in shallow seas which once covered this area. The Flathead Sandstone contains hematite, a red iron mineral, that was mined in this area from 1870 to the early 1900s.  The now abandoned mines were located in the rock outcrops located a mile to the south of this sign. Some of the mined hematite was used as a \"barn red\" paint pigment noted for its durability and covering qualities. This popular \"Rawlins Red\" enjoyed the distinction of being selected in 1893, as paint for the newly constructed Brooklyn Bridge. Hundreds of tons of ore were extracted annually between 1879 and 1886, and the paint made from it was used all across the country on a wide variety of building and structures. Cost increases for extracting, shipping and processing the ore as well as technical advances in paint manufacture eventually led to permanent closure of the mines.","LAT_1":41.82350097,"LON_1":-107.2311667,"LAT_2":41.8235,"LON_2":-107.2311,"Location":"41.8235, -107.2311","Location_X":-107.2311,"Location_Y":41.8235,"COUNTY":"Carbon","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464050248_39bb2b6869_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":822,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12250071.2773533,5291644.96271217]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":822,"FID":709,"MAMID":"SU0020.94","SIGNNAME":"Pinckey W.

The small town of Marquette was located here and had a post office, general store, dance hall, school, and saloon. A number of ranches and farms were scattered throughout this area. The tiny town was the social and economic center of the valley.  The town of Marquette was named for George Marquette, a Civil War veteran who moved to this area in 1878. Known as “Uncle” George by most, he was a fine fiddle player and was in great demand to play at dances in the late 1800s and early 1900s. He was also the first postmaster for the town. Rodeos were a chance for outlying ranch families to get together with friends and neighbors. Bronc busting was a favorite event. Early rodeos were very basic without fenced arenas to separate the contestants from the spectators. In 1905, Marquette’s Frontier Day Rodeo was held near the town’s General Store.  Cedar Mountain is clearly visible in this undated Marquette rodeo picture.  The Payne and MacGlashan General Store provided dry goods, hay, oats and other supplies for the local ranchers.

The remnant of Wiley's Ditch in front of you continues into the Oregon Basin and is a reminder of the most ambitious private irrigation project ever attempted in the region.  In 1907, a national financial crash and engineering problems doomed the partially completed project.    Dreaming of a farming empire in the arid Bighorn Basin of Wyoming.  Wiley began his project after the passage of the Carey Land Act in 1894.  At the height of construction, nearly 250 men from around the region worked for the Big Horn Basin Development Company on the complicated system of ditches, tunnels and off-stream reservoirs.  Work camps along the ditch had telephone, telegraph service and electric power.  Crews used state-of-the art electricdrills and a 45-ton steam shovel to work on the ditch.  Wiley developed two coal mine complexes in the area and logged timber on Carter Mountain to support the development of the region.  Meanwhile his surveyors began laying out a railroad line across the Basin to Yellowstone National Park that would be used to service company developed towns.  Of the four towns planned by Wiley, only Germania, today known as Emblem, still exists.  Wiley's plans for the future called for a massive hydro-electric plant and a surgar beet factory.  He also planned to use the entire Oregon Basin depression as a reservoir for the irrigation system and to power the hydro-electric generators.      In 1907, Wiley's backing collapsed and the Big Horn Basin Development Company went under.  Never again has such a grand irrigation project been tried by a private company.

Even with all of the mine modernization, the basic approach remained the same. As mines updated, the Sheridan mines continued to be known as state-of-the-art.  Miners went from skilled craftsmen to machine operators. The use of machines improved coal production and decreased the number of miners needed.

After an internee Boy Scout drowned while swimming in the canal during the summer of 1943, the Administration ordered a large pit excavated just below the canal. The pit was lined with gravel and filled with water, and it became the Heart Mountain swimming hole.  One of the main problems facing the Heart Mountain administrators was keeping the internees busy. Swimming, a popular summer activity, was supervised by lifeguards and swimming instructors.  During the long winter, ice-skating was a popular sport new to most internees. Youth football, basketball, baseball and softball teams were organized. High school sports teams were allowed to become members of the Wyoming Athletic Association and competed against surrounding schools. Judo, Kendo, sumo wrestling, boxing and girls’ volleyball, basketball and softball teams were also organized. Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and Campfire Girls troops were active. After camp restrictions wear eased, they could hike up Heart Mountain, camp on the Shoshone River, and practice outdoor cooking, and crafts. Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson of Cody, Wyoming and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta, a former internee, met as Boy Scouts at the Heart Mountain Camp when the Cody troop came to visit the internee troop. These two Scouts formed a lifelong friendship and served together in the United States Congress.  The internees also adopted many hobbies including painting, woodcarving, cabinetry, pottery, flower arranging, and needlework. They participated in camp sponsored plays, dances, and traditional acts such as poetry writing, mandolin, and Noh drama.

The dense growth of chokecherry, red-osier dogwood and wild rose bushes provide nesting areas and shelter from predators. Birds also eat the berries that grow on these plants. Insects are attracted by the cool water, and many birds eat the abundant insects in and around the Rise. Like all riparian zones, the Rise attracts wildlife of all kinds. Water is often hard to find in Wyoming and these bands of moisture are vital for the health of people and wildlife. Riparian zones need to be protected from development and pollution.

Native American tribes from the Great Basin region to the west crossed this area to hunt buffalo on the eastern plains.  From 1810 until the decline of the Rocky Mountain fur trade in the late 1830’s fur traders and trappers traversed this region on their way west in quest of beaver pelts, then retraced their route east laden with furs. These men left little evidence of their passing, but they explored the routes used by thousands of future settlers destined for locations west of Wyoming.  Although suggestions to  built a transcontinental railroad had been made in the 1840’s, no decision was reached until after the outbreak of the Civil War when Congress selected a central route through southern Wyoming. The Union Pacific Railroad, chartered by Congress, built track westward from Nebraska through Wyoming to Utah.  The military constructed a series of forts along the Union Pacific route to protect construction crews against attack by hostile Indians. Fort Fred Steele, named in honor of Civil War hero Major General Frederick Steele, was established in June, 1868 where the railroad crossed the North Platte River. Until 1886, when it was decommissioned, the garrison at Fort Fred Steele performed a variety of policing activities involving both Indians and civilians.  The railroad also promoted mercantile development, and livestock, lumber and mining industries. After the departure of the military, these industries continued and the town of Fort Steele survived. Completion of the transcontinental Lincoln Highway through Wyoming in 1922 contributed to a brief economic revival but rerouting of the highway in 1939 and the demise of the tie industry in 1940 ended the town’s function as a commercial center.

Having a low tolerance for pollution, large Mayfly and Stonefly populations are an effective indicator of a healthy environment and good to excellent water quality.  More than just a food pantry, the creek’s gravel bottom, oxygenated and washed by the rippling flow of the water also provides areas necessary for trout to spawn. Starting in November Brown trout will scour off portions of the creek bottom to form spawning beds called “redds.” A quiet, careful, observer may see the trout lying in these clean, white gravel beds as they lay and fertilize their eggs. After about two months, the eggs hatch and the young trout, or “alevin,” emerge to begin a new life cycle and hopefully survive to provide future fishing opportunities for anglers of all ages.

Responding to pressure for Western settlement, Congress created the Reclamation Service in 1902. Its purpose was to develop water resources by making possible cultivation of what was considered desert wasteland. One effort was the Riverton Project. Located in the Wind River Basin it was undertaken by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1920. The Midvale Irrigation District of the Riverton Project involves 73,000 acres, three dams -- Bull Lake Dam to the south and Diversion Dam and Pilot Butte Dam to the east, 100 miles of canals and 300 miles of laterals. Diversion Dam, completed in 1923, diverts water from the Wind River to the Wyoming Canal. It is noteworthy as the first dam in the nation with a road incorporated into its structure and the first to contain a fish ladder. Historian T.A. Larson describes the Riverton irrigation project as \"a perennial object lesson in the formidable difficulties inherent in large-scale reclamation projects in the West.\" Initially posing financial and engineering problems, it came to involve legal and political issues. During the rise of Native American self determination the Arapaho and Shoshone tribes exercised their right to Wind River water, granted by an 1868 treaty. Court battles were fought over water used to irrigate land opened to homesteading by Congress in 1905. The struggle highlights the importance of water to the West.","LAT_1":43.22892034,"LON_1":-109.0085391,"LAT_2":43.2289,"LON_2":-109.0085,"Location":"43.2289, -109.0085","Location_X":-109.0085,"Location_Y":43.2289,"COUNTY":"Fremont","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464765947_e5da5ec4e6_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":1014,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11953595.3465657,5475505.97948137]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1014,"FID":872,"MAMID":"WA0017E.10","SIGNNAME":"Welcome to the Wigwam Fish Rearing Station","LEGEND":"The Wigwam Fish Rearing Station is situated at the mouth of Ten Sleep Canyon at the base of the Big Horn Mountains.

In 1903, survey work began on major irrigation projects in the region. Ditches were dug and Big Horn River water was diverted to irrigate the dry desert landscape. Sugar beets were the crop of choice. Much of this activity centered from Worland’s sister community of Hanover on the east bank of the river. With the construction of these irrigation projects, Worland quickly grew into a small town with a bright agricultural future. In 1905 regional promoters convinced the Burlington Railroad and Lincoln Land Company to build south into the Big Horn Basin from Montana. Construction began early fall with tracks being laid on the east bank of the Big Horn River. To accommodate the location of the incoming railroad, Worland citizens hoisted their homes, offices, business buildings, and school onto log skids and “slid” them across the frozen river during the winter of 1905-1906.

When startled, rattlesnakes vibrate their tails. The loose interlocking segments of the rattle click against each other to create a distinct sound.  The rattle is made of keratin, similar to human fingernails. You cannot tell the age of a rattler by the number of rattles. Rattles are the remains of periodic skin shedding, and young snakes may shed several times a year.  Rattlesnakes are not aggressive and will only strike if surprised or harassed.

He was raised in Iowa and farmed in Nebraska before coming to Wyoming in 1895, where he established a homestead on the west bank of the Big Horn River. As a part of the homestead, he built a dugout stage station along the old Bridger Trail near where the trail crossed the river. The Bridger Trail was pioneered by mountain man Jim Bridger working under a government contract to find a safe route between the Oregon Trail at Red Buttes (near present Casper, Wyoming) and the new gold fields centered near Virginia City and Nevada City in southwestern Montana.  In 1864 Bridger led 62 wagons and some 300 emigrants along his new wagon road. Nine other wagon trains would follow that same year, avoiding conflicts with the Sioux and Cheyenne tribes that were patrolling the “Bloody Bozeman” trail to the east. The Bozeman Trail had opened a year earlier, but violated Indian treaty lands on the east side of the Big Horn Mountains. In spite of its safer route, the Bridger Trail never gained favor with the gold seekers and settlers. Its route was difficult for heavy wagons to negotiate and few sources of good water were available. By the late 1800s, it had evolved into a passage for pioneer wagons, freight wagons and stage coaches serving frontier communities, farms and ranches in the developing Big Horn Basin.  Neiber’s stage coaches were little more than buckboards capable of carrying three or four people. Some were even covered. Nonetheless, they served a purpose for that place and time. As the tracks of the Burlington Railroad approached from the north, the railroad’s contract land company, the Lincoln Land Company, surveyed town sites along the route. Neiber was one such planned town, but the promise never became reality.","LAT_1":43.924139,"LON_1":-108.063374,"LAT_2":43.9241,"LON_2":-108.0633,"Location":"43.9241, -108.0633","Location_X":-108.0633,"Location_Y":43.9241,"COUNTY":"Washakie","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464774747_69be21eacc_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":461,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12356747.8214287,5300104.83252227]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":461,"FID":721,"MAMID":"LN0003.92","SIGNNAME":"First Post Office Monument","LEGEND":"Daughters of Utah Pioneers No. 277  Erected 1963  FIRST POST OFFICE    Thayne, formerly called Glencoe, was founded in 1888, at which time mail was brought into Star Valley by team and wagon and distributed to the people from a log cabin owned by Joseph Thayne.

He found his way into the southwest as a young man, where he was a freighter with ox-drawn wagons.  When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Jim White served the Confederate Army as a grain buyer and wagon boss. At the end of the Civil War, Jim White married and returned to the southwest.  In 1868 he drifted down into Mexico, where a rich Spaniard won his wife away. White killed him and wounded several others in the fracas that followed.  There was a large reward offered for him, dead or alive. This was when he dropped his original name and adopted the name Jim White, for which he is known. His original name is unknown.  White walked 700 miles back into Texas where he got into the buffalo hunting profession. White kept several skinners busy as he preyed on the wandering herds.  One day a group of ciboleros rode over a hill and scared away a small herd of buffalo that White was firing on. In a fit of temper, he shot the horses out from under four of the party.  Jim White was hunting in the Texas Panhandle during the mid 1870’s. He was in the region at the time of the Battle of Adobe Walls and other lesser battles with the Kiowas and Commanches.  White had the reputation in Texas for being a tough character. He operated best alone or with his own men.  By 1878 the buffalo on the Southern Plains were gone. Many hunters started looking toward the unspoiled Northern Plains of Wyoming and Montana.  Jim White was among the first hunters to reach the northern buffalo range. By late summer, 1878, he had reached the Big Horn Mountains with two big span of mules, two wagons, 700 pounds of lead, five kegs of gunpowder, three 16 pound Sharp’s rifles, varied equipment, and an old buffalo skinner named Watson.  White soon met Oliver Hanna, who had been a scout with General Crook in 1876, and they became hunting partners.  During the winter of 1878-79 the two men had a contract to furnish 5,000 pounds of game meat to the Army at Fort McKinney, near present Buffalo, Wyoming.  The following winter of 1879-80, White and Hanna had a buffalo hunting camp north of the Yellowstone River near Miles City. The two hunters kept six buffalo skinners busy. By spring, they had collected 4,600 buffalo hides which were freighted to the Yellowstone River by ox teams and then hauled down the river by steam boats.  In the following fall of 1880, White and Hanna came into the Big Horn Basin and set up a hunting camp on Shell Creek, near the foot of the Big Horn Mountains. They were hunting and trapping in the area. In later October, Hanna made a quick trip over the Big Horns. When he returned he found Jim White dead. He had been shot in the head by thieves who had stolen their horses, mules, wagons, guns, hides, furs, etc.  Hanna buried Jim White on the upper bank, on the north side of Shell Creek, presently on the ranch of Irvy Davis near Shell, Wyoming.  Hanna later stated that Jim White was the greatest buffalo hunter the world has ever known. Hanna stated that White had a ledger book that contained records of hide sales for over 16,000 buffalo.  Jim White, who had lived by the gun, now, also died by the gun.  Recent examination of his remains revealed that he was killed by a 50 caliber bullet; probably from a Sharp’s buffalo rifle. Possible from the same gun that killed his own victims.  The bronze statue of White was sculpted and donated by Tom Hillis of Stanton Michigan.","LAT_1":44.51517,"LON_1":-109.10531,"LAT_2":44.5151,"LON_2":-109.1053,"Location":"44.5151, -109.1053","Location_X":-109.1053,"Location_Y":44.5151,"COUNTY":"Park","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49782121541_f759ed35eb_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":776,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11910686.6477142,5569562.54782556]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":776,"FID":1050,"MAMID":"SH0013.92","SIGNNAME":"O.

The aromatic, silver-grey sagebrush is the most common plant seen. It is a tall wintergreen shrub. Since it often sticks up through the snow it is a critical food source for Mule Deer and Pronghorn Antelope. The most common kind of sagebrush in this area is Big Sage. Growing alongside sage is bitterbrush, rabbitbrush and greasewood. Wildflowers such as Lupine, Indian Paintbrush, Sego Lily and dozens of others make a bright splash of color in the spring. Many birds make a home in sagebrush habitat. Prairie Falcons, Burrowing Owls, Sage Grouse, Horned Larks and others live here. Sage is also home to Antelope, Prairie Dogs, Badgers, Ground Squirrels and Coyotes. Loss of sagebrush habitat threatens all of these species.

The combination of open sagebrush meadows, steep hills and draws, and trees and shrubs along the river, provide cover and food for the animals. The deer in this area generally have a migration range of only a few miles. Some travel higher into the mountains during the warmer months, but for many this area is an example of a local habitat supplying most of the deer’s requirements for food, shelter, water and security. This area is especially important in the winter. Healthy winter range is important to give animals a chance to survive the year. Most winter ranges just sustain deer through the winter. If winter range or the migration corridor to winter range is lost to development it is even harder for deer to survive or raise fawns.  In summer mule deer eat mostly grasses and forbs. In fall and winter the leaves and twigs of shrubs are their food source. In this area most of the Mule Deer’s winter diet is made up of sagebrush. This low evergreen shrub pokes up through the snow so deer can get to it. They will also browse on the leaves and tender branches of bitterbrush sumac, snowberry, serviceberry, currant and mountain mahogany. Keeping these shrubs healthy in a mixed range environment is important to sustain Mule Deer populations across Wyoming.  Fire is a key tool to keep landscapes healthy. Fire was the main force that formed the habitat for many of the wildlife we cherish today. Aspen stands and many other plants need a fire every 80 to 100 years to regenerate. Mule Deer thrive in early successional habitats where forbs and younger shrubs dominate. These environments are not as stable as mature forests and rely on fire or other disturbances to regenerate them. If they are not disturbed they eventually become stable plant communities dominated by trees and large shrubs. Tree dominated habitats offer shelter but little food for deer. It is important to provide Mule Deer with a mosaic of habitats that provide food, cover and water. Fire suppression and habitat fragmentation are two factors that have caused Mule Deer populations to decline. Stopping all wildfires creates habitats dominated by mature trees or one kind of plant. Habitat fragmentation breaks up winter range and disrupts migration corridors.  After breeding in the fall a doe gives birth to one to three fawns in June. The birth weight is 7-9 pounds. The Fawn is born with light spots which are retained until the fall molt. The first few days of a fawn’s life are critical to its survival. It must remain motionless and rely on protective coloration to avoid predators. If you come across a bedded fawn that appears to be abandoned, please do not touch it! You contaminate the fawn with your scent so predators can find it. The mother is nearby feeding and will return.  The Mule Deer gets its name from the large, mule-like ears. It has a large, whitish rump patch with a short, black-tipped tail. Males have heavy, up-swept antlers that are equally branched into forked tines. A full grown buck can weigh between 200 and 350 pounds. One of the Mule Deer’s best-known characteristics is it bouncing gait which is known as “stotting.” When it stots, a Mule Deer bounds and lands with all four legs at the same time, so it looks like it’s using a pogo stick. This stiff-legged jump allows the deer to move safely and rapidly across the broken, brushy terrain it lives in.  Mule deer and bison can easily use the same area because they have different needs for food and space. Deer eat more shrubs and are active at dawn and dusk. The bison eat grasses and are active during the day, although both try to find shade … during the hottest part of the day … (can’t read the rest).","LAT_1":43.65993,"LON_1":-108.1909,"LAT_2":43.6599,"LON_2":-108.1909,"Location":"43.6599, -108.1909","Location_X":-108.1909,"Location_Y":43.6599,"COUNTY":"Hot Springs","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464768207_0e5173cd29_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":596,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12145568.7027455,5545602.57120913]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":596,"FID":982,"MAMID":"PA0019E.11","SIGNNAME":"George Drouillard","LEGEND":"GEORGE DROUILLARD (c. 1775-1810).

More than 10,000 men, women and children lived in the area bounded on your left by the red brick home in the distance, the hill ahead of you, the hospital on your right and the area where you are now standing. It was the third largest community in Wyoming. A diagram of a typical block and the layout of a barracks are shown. There were 30 blocks.  Relocation center housing was similar to that seen in temporary military camps of the time. Construction began in June 1942 with more than 2,500 workers, many of whom were from nearby communities. The government hired every man who could swing a hammer and the jobs were a huge boost to the regional economy. Thirteen million board feet of #3 grade green pine and spruce lumber arrived by railroad. A single barrack could be constructed in fifty-eight minutes. Quality of construction was of little concern. The barracks housing, mess halls, latrines, administrative and hospital buildings were erected in sixty-two days at a 1942 cost of $5.5 million dollars.  The green lumber shrank when it dried, leaving gaps between the boards of up to one-half inch. The outer walls were covered with black tar paper and lath. This type of construction created many hardships for the internees during the cold Wyoming winters.  Each barracks building was 120 feet long by 20 feet wide. The building was divided into six single rooms, two 20 by 24 feet, two 20 by 16 feet and two 20 by 20 feet. The larger rooms were for families of six or more individuals. These barracks apartments supplied only basic protection against the elements. There was no individual or family privacy. Each room was furnished with a coal burning pot-bellied stove and a single light fixture hanging from the open ceiling. Coal was dumped in a central location in each block and internees hauled what they needed each day. In addition, each internee was issued an army style cot with mattress and two wool blankets. Partitions for privacy usually consisted of blankets draped across a rope that spanned the room. The internees made furniture from scrap lumber. In late December 1942 and early January 1943, Celotex, a type of insulation wallboard, finally arrived for the internees to install ceilings and walls.  Each block was made up of 24 barracks, two buildings, with showers, lavatories, and laundry tubs, two mess halls, and two recreation halls. Each block held about 550 persons.  Internees had to leave their apartments to use the latrine and shower facilities and to go to the mess halls for meals. The communal nature of the latrine and shower facilities destroyed any semblance of personal privacy. The communal nature of the mess halls also caused a breakdown in family structure, as children were not required to eat at the same time or at the same table as their parents.  All staple foodstuffs were requisitioned from Army Quartermaster stations and wartime food rationing was observed. Certain foods were more popular than others and the cry, “No more rutabagas,” was often heard.  Within the living area of the relocation center were barracks set aside for Buddhist and Christian worship, schools, and later a community enterprise store, shoe repair shop, barber ship, beauty shop, radio shop, dry cleaners, two movie theaters and a library. Eventually a United Service Organization (USO) lounge was opened to entertain Nisei servicemen visiting their families.  What might appear to have been a “normal community” never was normal because of the surrounding barbed wire, guard towers and lack of personal freedom and privacy for the internees.","LAT_1":44.67017,"LON_1":-108.94943,"LAT_2":44.6701,"LON_2":-108.9494,"Location":"44.6701, -108.9494","Location_X":-108.9494,"Location_Y":44.6701,"COUNTY":"Park","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49773733713_93bcebb6f2_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":939,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12348919.3561623,5051512.47422284]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":939,"FID":110,"MAMID":"UT0012.11","SIGNNAME":"Bear River Region","LEGEND":"Beginning high in the Uinta Mountains south of Evanston, the Bear River meanders more than 500 miles, through Idaho, Wyoming and Utah, ending in the Great Salt Lake, less than 100 miles from it’s origin. This route makes the Bear River the Northern Hemisphere’s longest river that does not flow into an ocean.  During the late 17th and early 18th century, before the white  man’s arrival, this region was widely used by Shoshone, Arapaho, and Uintah Indians who camped here while hunting the abundant wildlife and gathering berries. They called the river “Quee-yaw-pah” for a tobacco root growing along it’s bank. Trappers called it the “Bear River” because of the many bears that frequented the area. Indians and trappers sometimes held rendezvous in this region. The Burntfork Rendezvous held in 1825, just 50 miles southeast of here was the first rendezvous of traders and trappers to be held in the Rocky Mountains.  Between 1840 and 1870, more than 500,000 emigrants traveled through this area bound for opportunity in the Oregon Territory, the Great Basin, and the California gold fields. In 1843 famed mountain man, Jim Bridger, and his partner, Louis Vasquez, established a trading post that soon became Fort Bridger. Located just 35 miles east of here, it became a welcome spot to rest, resupply, trade animals, and get necessary blacksmith work done.  During the development of America’s Transcontinental Railroad, tie hacks cut railroad ties in the Uinta Mountains to the south. The Bear River’s spring runoff was used to float them to the railway to construct and maintain the railroad you see on the west bank of the river. The Union Pacific Railroad depended on this river as a source of water for their steam engines and for ice that was cut, stored in nearby ice houses and then used to protect perishables before the advent of refrigerator cars.  Geologically, this region is part of the Overthrust Belt, a series of folds and faults that formed over a vast period as two enormous land masses compressed together. These land mass movements caused the crust of the earth to overlap by as much as 60 miles, burying petroleum source rocks deep beneath the surface where high temperatures stimulated the generation of oil and gas. Oil, gas and minerals play a major role in southwestern Wyoming as evidenced by the presence of many energy and mineral related companies. The world’s largest deposits of trona are located just east of here. Mines in this region produce two thirds of the world’s supply of soda ash (a trona derivative).  Today the Bear River is used for recreation, agriculture and municipal water. Many species of wildlife use the river habitat. Visitors enjoy viewing antelope, deer, and the occasional moose or elk, and many small animals. Bird watchers enjoy Eagles, Great Blue Herons, Sand Hill Cranes, several species of ducks, Canada Geese, and .. song birds.  Bear River State Park, established in 1991, provides visitors with the opportunity to hike the trails following in the footsteps of Jim Bridger, Cut Face Sublette, Hugh Glass, and Chief Washakie, or enjoy viewing the bison and elk herds. Visitors can fish for Bear River Cutthroat Trout or just relax under a large cottonwood tree and imagine what it might have been like to confront a 600 lb Grizzly along the river’s edge. Winter provides unique viewing opportunities from numerous cross country ski trails.

Divided by a hallway, each officer has a private bedroom and parlor. They share a dining room and kitchen, which is usually the working area of the maid who is provided a small room next to the kitchen for her sleeping quarters.  After the turn of the century the rest of the log officer’s quarters, and many other wooden buildings were sold at public auction and carted off to become parts of local ranges and homesteads.

Reynolds, Topographical Engineers, U.S. Army, to reconnoiter Rocky Mountain topography and potential routes leading to areas of indicated mineralization. Old Jim Bridger, noted explorer since fur trade days, was Reynolds' guide. In 1864, official energy was still concentrated on the Civil War and that most famous of mountain men laid out this road himself. The Oregon Trail was the trunk line of western roads. Although Montana's mines lay far north of its course, further west -- in Idaho -- a branch-road turned off to those diggings. But that right-angle-turn added some 200 time-consuming, exhausting miles to the shortest feasible roadway.

Still, by crossing Indian hunting grounds, his road increased the hazard of overland freight and travel. Bridger's route -- west of the Big Horns -- reduced danger from Indian attacks while saving ten days time. But the Bridger Road was a compromise.

Wetlands are one of the most rewarding places to experience Wyoming’s incredible diversity of wildlife. For waterfowl hunters wetlands are the most important place to practice their sport. Bird watchers can find no better place to see a magnificent diversity of wildlife, and all animals depend on the food, water and shelter found near wetlands habitat even if they don’t live there full time.  Wetlands are a necessary part of our landscape – in addition to providing vital wildlife habitat, they serve people’s needs by controlling flooding and filtering pollutants.  Wetlands are one of the most fragile and endangered habitats. Today less than half of the original wetlands that existed when the United states was founded are still here. This loss of habitat has dramatically affected populations of many birds and animals. The Wyoming Game and Fish, State Parks and other agencies are preserving remaining Wyoming wetlands for future generations of people and wildlife.  OSPREY Osprey’s are seen …above mountain lakes or perched atop their large stick nests. These large, majestic raptors feed mainly on fish and are uniquely equipped as anglers. Their feathers are water resistant and their feet are shaped to hold onto squirming fish, two toes face forward and two backward and the bird’s feet are heavily sealed to clamp tightly on the fish. Osprey will dive feet first into the water to snag a fish. As they fly they turn the fish so it faces forward to decrease wind resistance.  CALIFORNIA GULL One of several gulls seen here, these large white birds feed on insects, fish and forage for carrion. The state bird of Utah, the California Gull has a white head and yellow bill with a distinct red and black spot on the lower bill. They breed in large communities nesting on open shorelines.  KILLDEER  Named for its loud distinctive call, the Killdeer is a large plover. These birds live in many habitats, but are often seen in open, wet areas where they forage for insects. If a predator approaches, a nesting Killdeer performs a “broken wing” act. It calls rapidly and drags its wing and often a foot as if it is wounded. Once the predator is lured away from the nest the Killdeer flies safely away.  SPOTTED SANDPIPER This is the most widespread sandpiper in North America. It is distinguishable on the ground by the way it constantly teeters its body as it stands with tail up and head down. It has a stiff winged flight pattern swooping low over the water and shore. This bird is unusual in that the females defend nesting territories while the males tend to the nests and eggs.  RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD In the summer, cattail wetlands in Wyoming ring out with the calls of the male Red-Winged Blackbird aggressively staking out and defending mating territory. The male has a bright red and yellow shoulder patch, the female has a mottled brown and white body.

GOLDEN EAGLE Because its prey is drawn to the water around the reservoir, the Golden Eagle is seen soaring above the shorelines. They swoop down on rabbits, marmots, squirrels, eat carrion and will eat fish and reptiles when they can. They nest on cliffs overlooking an open area with a good food supply.

The 345 mile Central Division of the Pacific Wagon Road went from South Pass, Wyoming, to City of Rocks, Idaho, a geologic formation, which marked the Division's western boundary. Superintendent Frederick W. Lander of Salem, Massachusetts supervised construction for the U.S. Department of the Interior. The 256 mile section of road leading from South Pass to Fort Hall, Idaho, is known as the Lander Cut-off. Here the cut-off traverses the Smoking Creek Canyon, now known as the Stump Creek Canyon. The new route afforded water, wood, and forage for emigrants and their stock. Between 1858 and 1912, it provided travelers with a new, shorter route to Oregon and California, saving wagon trains seven days. Lander, with a crew of 15 engineers, surveyed the route in the summer of 1857. The following summer, 115 men, many recruited from Salt Lake City's Morman emigrants, constructed the road in less than 90 days at a cost of $67,873.

The pathway, in combination with the river, made the area a stopping place for Native Americans and later explorers, including the Mountain Men. With the advent of travel to Oregon, California, and Utah, it also became a stop for wagon trains on this part of the Oregon/California/Utah trial. The Donner party encamped here on July 24, 1846 having made its fateful decision to try a new shortcut to California beyond Fort Bridger. Seven miles east of here, on June 28, 1847, the first Mormon wagon train with the Prophet Brigham Young met with frontiersman Jim Bridger on the Little Sandy River. The next day, the Mormons rested at the Big Sandy before pushing on to reach the Green River that same day. By 1858, the Big Sandy Mail Station had developed as a site for mail service between the Missouri River and Salt Lake City.

For thousands of years people and wildlife have followed the river through the canyon to the mountains. This overlook is at 6800’. Below the canyon you can see the Lander Valley (elevation 5300’), a part of the Wind River Basin. On the far horizon are the Owl Creek Mountains, 75 miles away. The Wind River Basin covers all of Fremont County, an area equal in size to the state of Massachusetts. Temperature in the basin range from 30 below zero in the winter to over 100 degrees in summer. Precipitation levels vary greatly across this vast area – from the desert-like Sand Hills to permanent snowfields along the continental divide. The town of Shoshoni at the base of the Owl Creek average 5” of precipitation a year. Lander receives about 14” a year. The high peaks in the mountains get 50-70” of precipitation a year and enough snowfall to allow permanent glaciers. Much of Wyoming is arid and most of the water that supports life comes from snowpack in the mountains. Without this supply of clean water, life would be impossible in much of the state.  The north facing slope is in the shade much of the winter. This allows snow to build up and provide moisture needed for the lush growth of Douglas Fir and Limber pines that blanket the steep slopes. This side of the canyon is good habitat for Pine Martins, Black Bears, squirrels, Townsends Solitaires, and Blue Grouse.  Aspen Groves are an important habitat. They grow in moist mountain meadows. The trees provide shade, but allow enough sunshine for grasses and sedges to grow. Porcupine, beaver and moose use these meadows and many songbirds are found there.  The riparian zone along the river is a critical habitat for all wildlife. All birds and animals spend time along this lush green band of vegetation seeking water and food. Riparian zones are important travel corridors for wildlife as they move from winter to summer range. The high water table along the riparian zone allows trees and shrubs such as willow, chokecherry, dogwood and cottonwood to thrive. Grasses, sedges and wildflowers grow in abundance with the extra moisture.  The south facing slope of the canyon receives a great deal of sunshine year-round. This keeps the snow melted off, creating a dryer habitat. Sagebrush, bitterbrush and juniper trees grow on this slope. The lack of heavy snow on this slope makes it good winter range for wildlife because they don’t have to struggle through snow to reach food and shelter. Mule Deer, Bighorn Sheep, Marmots, Cliff Swallows, Green-tailed Towhees and Golden Eagles live here.","LAT_1":42.73954,"LON_1":-108.82343,"LAT_2":42.7395,"LON_2":-108.8234,"Location":"42.7395, -108.8234","Location_X":-108.8234,"Location_Y":42.7395,"COUNTY":"Fremont","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464766942_0b1aa8c5a2_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":923,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12349241.0694907,5050905.29618536]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":923,"FID":93,"MAMID":"UT0006G.11","SIGNNAME":"Bear River Birds","LEGEND":"BEAR RIVER BIRDS There are many habitats around Bear River State Park.

Explorers and mountain men trapped beaver in the Seedskadee area; and the hundreds of thousands of pioneers who crossed the Green River hunted game here.  Construction of the Fontenelle Dam about 20 miles upstream changed the natural flooding cycle of the Green River, affecting the fish and wildlife habitat along the river. The dam created prime trout habitat; yet it endangered the natural marshlands bordering the river that relied on spring flooding. These marshlands are critical nesting habitat for many species of waterfowl.  Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge was established by Congress in 1965 to help offset the loss of marshlands habitat resulting from construction of both the Fontenelle Dam and the Flaming Gorge Dam which is about 100 miles downstream in Utah.

From there it travels west across the Green River Valley, the Wyoming Range, and the Salt River Range before entering present-day Idaho. The Cut-Off rejoins the original Oregon Trail near Fort Hall. This wagon road was favored by travelers for many reasons. The cut-off saved as much as 7 days travel compared to the old route through Fort Bridger, avoided the expensive ferries across the Green River to the south, and bypassed the 50-mile waterless desert of the Sublette Cut-Off.  Its longest waterless section was only 10 miles, and it had access to abundant grass and firewood.  The Lander Cut-Off was used by an estimated 13,000 emigrants its first year, with 9,000 of them signing a statement of support for the road at Fort Hall.  While use dwindled after completion of the trans-continental railroad in 1869, the trail was still used by emigrants into the 20th century and played a role in the settlement of the Upper Green River Valley.","LAT_1":42.42284105,"LON_1":-108.8722567,"LAT_2":42.4228,"LON_2":-108.8722,"Location":"42.4228, -108.8722","Location_X":-108.8722,"Location_Y":42.4228,"COUNTY":"Fremont","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464766132_dd962852a1_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":516,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11926009.1522328,5235385.36132898]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":516,"FID":501,"MAMID":"NA0020A.92","SIGNNAME":"Independence Rock - Oregon Trail Marker","LEGEND":"Oregon Trail Marked by State of Wyoming in 1914","LAT_1":42.494778,"LON_1":-107.133163,"LAT_2":42.4947,"LON_2":-107.1331,"Location":"42.4947, -107.1331","Location_X":-107.1331,"Location_Y":42.4947,"COUNTY":"Natrona","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464054683_e46c8970ef_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":528,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11926009.1522328,5235385.36132898]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":528,"FID":499,"MAMID":"NA0020M.92","SIGNNAME":"Independence Rock - Unknown Pioneers Monument","LEGEND":"OREGON TRAIL MEMORIAL (TOP - SEAL IN CENTER) - \"To all unknown Pioneers who passed this way to win and hold the west.

Embarking from what is now Green River, Wyoming in specially designed river dory boats, Powell completed two voyages down the Green and Colorado rivers through the Grand Canyon. The first, in 1869, was largely exploratory. The second, in 1871, collected scientific data and produced the first maps of the upper Colorado drainage system. Powell’s work formed the basis for much of what geologists now know about the region.  The Green River through Flaming Gorge is a classic example of a superposed steam – it flows across the eastern end of the Uinta Mountains, rather than draining away from the mountains. Geologists believe that, when the last major regional erosion cycle began several million years ago, an extensive landscape nearly level with the present crest of the Uintas dominated southern Wyoming. As erosion removed softer rock, the river level was gradually lowered, cutting a precipitous canyon into the resistant core of the Uintas. The result is the spectacular Red Canyon of the Green River, which chronicles earth history. Rocks in the very near area are young, only about 49 million years old. Traveling down tributary canyons, such as Little Firehole, and continuing downstream towards Flaming Gorge Dam, older rock formations contain a wide variety of fossils, ranging from dinosaurs to primitive sea life. Near Flaming Gorge Dam, the dark red sandstones and shales of the pre-Cambrian Uinta core form the near vertical canyon walls.

With an average summertime temperature of 44 degrees Fahrenheit, the clear, swift water provides ideal habitat for the mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly larvae that trout  love to eat, and that are found crawling on, or stuck to, the underside of the rocks in the creek bed. Sampling studies done by the Wyoming Department of Environment Quality show that more than 60% of the insects in the creek are from the Mayfly Family. Having a low tolerance for pollution, large Mayfly and Stonefly populations are an effective indicator of a healthy environment and good to excellent water quality.  More than just a food pantry, the creek’s gravel bottom, oxygenated and washed by the rippling flow of the water also provides areas necessary for trout to spawn. Starting in November Brown trout will scour off portions of the creek bottom to form spawning beds called “redds.” A quiet, careful, observer may see the trout lying in these clean, white gravel beds as they lay and fertilize their eggs. After about two months, the eggs hatch and the young trout, or “alevin,” emerge to begin a new life cycle and hopefully survive to provide future fishing opportunities for anglers of all ages.

Great horned owls are the only large owl with ear tufts. Their name comes from the tufted ears that create a horned silhouette. Just like a dog, great horned owls use their ears to convey body language – when irritated the tufts lie flat and when inquisitive the ears stand upright.  An owl cannot move its eyes up and down or side to side to compensate for this lack of movement, owls can rotate their heads 270 degrees.  Deer mice are one of the owl’s favorite foods.

His venture marked the first time sugar beets were planted in the Big Horn Basin. By 1909, growers in the area were under contract to cultivate sugar beets, which were then sent by rail to Billings, Montana. The Wyoming Sugar Company of Ogden, Utah, announced its plan to construct a beet sugar factory in Worland in 1916. 150 men finished the $1 million factory in just one year. Despite concerns about delays in beet shipments caused by slow railroad construction and a shortage of cars, the factory was completed on schedule. The Wyoming Sugar Company’s president, J.M. Eccles, opened its doors on October 17, 1917. The first day of operations the factory sliced 260 tons of beets. Workers lived in row houses built by the company. Known as “sugar tramps,” they were mostly young Mormons, along with families from Japan, Russia, Germany and Mexico. Holly Sugar Corporation acquired the Worland factory in 1925. By 1939, the beet receiving station was equipped to handle more than 70,000 tons of beets, making it the largest in the world at the time. In the early years, sugar beets were topped by hand, but by the 1950s and 1960s machine harvesting took over in the beet fields. When Holly Sugar Corporation announced in 2001 that they factory would close its doors, local growers, landowners, and business people in the Big Horn Basin and Fremont County formed a cooperative to purchase the factory.

Johnston, described as a 6’6”, 250 pound giant, came west in the early 1840’s as a trapper. He began his career in the Medicine Bow mountains of Wyoming, gradually working his way northward through the Wind River, Owl Creek, and Absaroka Mountains, then into the Yellowstone Region and Montana.  About 1850 Johnston had acquired a Flathead Indian wife, of whom he was very fond, and had built a cabin on the Little Snake in Wyoming. One day, on returning from trapping, he found his wife and unborn child dead and mutilated on the cabin floor. They had been killed by Crow Indians.  This started a personal revenge war against the Crows, which lasted nearly twelve years. According to legend, Johnston would on occasion remove the liver from a dead enemy and take a bite of it, or pretend to, in order to make a fierce impression on his savage foes. Consequently, he received the name “Liver Eating” Johnston.  Johnston went to Colorado in 1862 and enlisted in the Second Colorado Cavalry to fight in the Civil War. He was wounded in Missouri at the Battle of Newtonia, but remained in the service until his Honorable Discharge on September 23, 1865.  The winter after the war was spent in Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where he was hired to help supply buffalo and elk meat for the Army post.  Johnston worked his way north to the Missouri River in Montana where he started a wood yard, supplying firewood for the steamboats that were traveling the river in those days.  In 1868, at the mouth of the Musselshell River, Johnston and some companions defeated a Sioux war party that intended to wipe out the group of trappers and wood cutters.  In 1877, Johnston became Chief of Scouts for General Nelson A. Miles. Johnston and ten scouts were credited with saving Miles command in a battle with the Cheyenne on Muddy Creek in 1877.  Johnston became the first Marshal at Coulson (Billings) Montana in 1882, and later in 1888, the first Sheriff of Red Lodge, Montana.  In old age he developed rheumatism, and in the late 1890’s would treat his ailment at the DeMaris Hot Springs, near the river just below the site of Old Trail Town. His camping spot was just beneath the cliffs that can be seen from the grave site.  In the winter of 1899 Johnston’s health failed him and he was sent to the old soldiers home in Santa Monica, California, where he died January 21, 1900.  “Liver Eating” Johnston, also known as Jeremiah Johnston from the Warner Bros. movie based on his life, was reburied near the mountains he loved on June 8, 1974.

The town became a thriving community – complete with a general store, hotel, school, post office, and several saloons.

A small number of ranchers grazed their cattle west of the Snake River in the area of the Potholes, south of Signal Mountain, moving them to summer range east of the river, crossing on the dam at Jackson Lake near the town of Moran, now removed but then located just west of here. When the new, larger national park was created in 1950, two things happened. One was that, unlike other national parks, grazing was permitted during the life of the ranchers at the time. The other was that the new park received more visitors. Herding cattle across the dam became problematic so the National Park Service and the ranchers agreed to find an alternate place to cross the river, and this was the location.  In the middle 1950s “Cattleman’s Bridge” was constructed, but not long afterwards, the Potholes ceased to be used for grazing. So the bridge was used for cattle drives only a short while. The bridge remained, however, and was used in the following decades by people hiking or fishing. In 1962 the bridge even appeared prominently in one scene of the movie Spencer’s Mountain.  The bridge was finally taken down in 2001 after it had partially collapsed. While it existed, however, the bridge revealed one aspect of the distinctive history of Grand Teton National Park.","LAT_1":43.85656,"LON_1":-110.5534,"LAT_2":43.8565,"LON_2":-110.5534,"Location":"43.8565, -110.5534","Location_X":-110.5534,"Location_Y":43.8565,"COUNTY":"Teton","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464550406_9b33e8c602_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":58,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12081216.6862298,5536698.34550866]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":58,"FID":932,"MAMID":"BH0008.08","SIGNNAME":"McCullough Peaks Wild Horses","LEGEND":"The Latter-Day Saints have always believed in the importance of education.

The first classes of this academy-to-be met in the grade school building while construction proceeded. Though the Mormon Church supplied the actual money required to build and equip the facility, by far the major portion of the project was accomplished with donated labor, expertise, and machines which were quite primitive by modern standards. The building was completed in 1916. Its program was essentially that of a high school although in the context of that time, it was thought of, almost, as a college. Students came to the Academy from a wide area to live and board, somewhat as students leave home today for high education. The Academy was operated as a church school until 1924 when its facilities and responsibilities were transferred to the Cowley School District thereafter known as the Cowley High School.

Although the majority of immigrants came from Poland, over 20 nationalities were represented in the Sheridan County mines. Many Polish food dishes, drinks, and holiday events continue to be celebrated throughout the community.  IMMIGRATION Thousands of immigrants found their way to the mines north of Sheridan. While differences existed among minders in the camps, as a general rule, the common experiences and dangers of the mines bonded the miners together, regardless of ethnicity.  AMERICANIZATION The mining settlements were arranged with each nationality comprising a neighborhood. Formal Americanization classes and the cultural melting pot of the communities resulted in assimilation into American culture.  UNIONIZATION In 1903, Dietz workers were the first in Wyoming to form a “local” within the United Mine Workers of America. Unionization resulted in higher wages, shorter hours, increased mine safety, and improved working conditions.  DISCRIMINATION Language barriers, cultural diversity, and a dependence on Sheridan as the regional hub led to discrimination between the larger town and the mining camps and towns. Even though the mines supported Sheridan, the larger town’s residents viewed those from the mining communities as second class citizens. In 1919, the Sheridan miners participated in a nationwide strike for higher wages, shorter workdays and work weeks. Shown above, the National Guard was called in to round up the miners striking at Carneyville and detained them at Fort MacKenzie. All miners were eventually released. They returned to work with a 14 percent raise.  THIS WAS DIETZ The Sheridan Fuel Company operated the Higby Dietz (pronounced “deetz”) Mine NO. 1 for the first time in March 1893. When Gould Dietz of Omaha began working closely with the mine company in 1897, the mine and its “model camp” took the name Dietz. Seven other Dietz mines operated in the same area until 1923. Residents abandoned the townsite by 1937. (photo caption) Before the Dietz mines closed, as many as 1,000 men worked in them and 3,000 people lived in the two company towns nearby.

Her birth place and family are unknown. It is known that she left home at an early age and changed her name. Belle was a rather attractive young woman; about five foot six inches tall, medium to heavy boned with auburn hair. No one knows how or why Belle showed up in Wyoming Territory in the 1880’s. However, it is suspected that she drifted west from mining towns in the Black Hills. She seemed to be drawn to the dark side of life and felt comfortable with the lawless element. A news item in the “Sundance Gazette” stated that in 188, Belle Drewry was arraigned in court, for theft, with a piano player who was known to be an outlaw with an unsavory reputation. She was 21 years old.  By 1890 Belle had arrived (probably by stage coach) at the frontier town of Arland, Wyoming. Arland was located about twenty-five miles south of present Cody, Wyoming and was the first settlement in northwest Wyoming. It was a lawless town with a reputation for unrestrained violence and murder. Belle Drewry worked in the saloon and dance hall. Here she got to know W.A. Gallagher, Blind Bill Hoolihan, Robert Parker (Butch Cassidy), Jack Bliss and other suspected members of a gang known as the “Woodriver Horse Thieves.”  Belle soon developed a close relationship with W.A. Gallagher a well known cowboy and horse thief. In 1891 Gallagher was lodged in the Fremont County Jail where he was held on charges of stealing a bar mare from the L U Ranch on Gooseberry Creek. Belle Drewry and Ed Lanigan put up $200.00 in bond money to get Gallagher out of jail.  Gallagher had the reputation of being a quarrelsome, and vicious man. By the spring of 1894 Belle’s relationship with Gallagher was deteriorating and she had developed a friendship with Bill Wheaton, another cowboy in the area. This resulted in a dispute in which Gallagher was shot and killed by Wheaton. Blind Bill, Gallaghers friend attempted a show down with Wheaton to avenge Gallagher’s death. However Blind Bill was shot in the back and died in his cabin in Arland after writing a farewell letter to the undertaker. Belle Drewry and Bill Wheaton were charged with premeditated murder in the death of Gallagher, apprehended, and taken to the County Jail in Lander, Wyoming. However, the charges against Belle were dismissed at the preliminary hearing. Bill Wheaton’s charge was later reduced to second degree manslaughter and was sentenced to eight years in the Wyoming Penitentiary at Laramie.  Belle continued her activities in the Arland-Meeteetse country and was well known. Early in 1897 Belle Drewry and three of her followers gave a party, one night. Everyone was drinking and the cowboys proceeded to shoot up the place. In the uproar that followed Belle pulled a six-shooter from a hiding place and shot the leader of the cowboy gang. A few days later, an unknown assassin came into the house and killed Belle Drewry, apparently in revenge, for their comrades death.  Belle was given a respectable burial on the hill overlooking Arland. Thirty year old Belle Drewry was laid to rest in a red wood coffin, wearing a cobalt blue silk dress with a black sash. When Belle was disinterred for reburial at Old Trail Town, fired 45-70 and 45-60 cartridge cases were found in the ground around the coffin. It appears that a parting salute was fired, and the cartridge cases were dropped into the open grave.  One might imagine; the boom of the rifles, the rolling echo across the hills and the black powder smoke drifting away with the wind like departing ghosts. – Perhaps, a fitting farewell from a wild land.

Use of the trail contributed to the “Plains Indian War” and military occupation of the region.\nIn the summer of 1865 a road building expedition managed by James A. Sawyers set out from Niobrara, NE headed to Virginia City, MT. When the expedition reached the Dry Fork of the Powder River, its route merged with the Bozeman Trail. General Patrick Connor attacked and destroyed an Arapaho village downstream on August 29, three days before Sawyers’ Expedition arrived at this crossing. In retaliation, an Arapaho war party laid siege to Sawyers’ encampment for 13 days until a military escort arrived.\nFrom 1879 through 1895, the Bingham Post Office operated near here on the north side of the Tongue River. Between 1879 and 1885, Bingham also served as a stage station along the Rock Creek Stage Line. This 400-mile line ran from Rock Creek on the Union Pacific Railroad in southern Wyoming to near present day Billings, MT. In 1882 the Northern Pacific Railroad stretched through Montana and the stage line served the important role of connecting the two railroads. By 1890 a variety of shorter rail and stage routes connected areas within the two states and the need for a Wyoming to Montana stage route came to an end.

To the casual observer this landscape may appear desolate, but sagebrush shrublands are diverse and home to a variety of wildflowers, birds, and animals.  Wyoming has more sagebrush than any other state, occupying more than 50% of its lands. Different species of sagebrush have distinct elevation, soil, and moisture requirements. Of the 13 different types of sagebrush found in Wyoming, six of the most common species are shown below.  (Starting in the middle and moving clockwise)  LEAVES All sagebrush species (except silver sagebrush) are evergreen. The aromatic leaves are covered with short, silver hairs – which reduce water loss and discourage insects. The leaves contain camphor and were used in traditional medicine to treat coughs, headaches, stomachaches, and fevers.  FLOWERS AND SEEDS Sagebrush produces tiny 1/8-inch long flowers from August to September. It reproduces from seeds cast by wind onto moist soils in the winter.  BARK Ute Indians wove the shredded bark into wicks for candles and made sacks of woven bark lined with grass.  ROOTS The root system extends as much as sick feet deep into the soil to access water during dry periods, and spreads widely around the plant to maximize water uptake during spring snowmelt.  TRUNK Woody part of the plant was burned for fuel and used to construct shelters.  SMALL BRANCHES Native Americas used smaller branches for weaving baskets and other household items. *Habitat, elevation and height listed for six types: Black Sagebrush, Mountain Big Sagebrush, Alkali Sagebrush, Mountain Silver Sagebrush, Basin Big Sagebrush, and Wyoming Big Sagebrush*  FOOD AND SHELTER Sagebrush provides shelter, food, and nesting habitat for all types of wildlife including several species whose declining populations are of conservation concern. The leaves are a nutritious and essential food source for wildlife, especially during the winter. For species such as sage grouse and pronghorn, sagebrush makes up over 95% of their winter diet and 50% of the summer diet.

Throughout this period, the Earth was more geologically active, with smaller continents colliding and forming larger continents. In what is now western Wyoming, an arc of volcanic islands was separated from once such continent by a deep underwater basin. Over millions of years, volcanic eruptions deposited thousands of feet of debris and rock into the basin. As geologic activity continued, gold, silica, and other minerals, were dissolved in superheated water deep within the earth. As the heated fluid migrated through cracks and faults toward the surface, it cooled and the silica hardened to produce quartz veins in which the gold deposits were embedded.  About 80 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous period, the continuous movement of the Earth’s plates caused a massive uplifting of rock, forming the Wind River Range. Over millions of years, erosion exposed gold-bearing veins of quartz. Particles of gold and other minerals eventually were washed into streams and deposited into the riverbeds – awaiting discovery by prospectors.  GOLD-BEARING ROCK  Mines in the South Pass area lie along a geologic feature called a shear zone – layers of rock that have undergone intense deformation. Gold is often associated with the veins of quartz found within shear zones. Prospectors would pan for gold in steams, and then followed the traces of yellow upstream in hopes of finding the “mother lode.” Placer mining – extraction of gold from deposits of sand and gravel in streambeds – was also common along Willow Creek.","LAT_1":42.46797,"LON_1":-108.8052,"LAT_2":42.4679,"LON_2":-108.8052,"Location":"42.4679, -108.8052","Location_X":-108.8052,"Location_Y":42.4679,"COUNTY":"Fremont","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49961609447_619ff4a28f_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":299,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12113040.0343408,5232005.94541353]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":299,"FID":480,"MAMID":"FR0094I.13","SIGNNAME":"Another Boom & Bust","LEGEND":"Another mining boom came to the South Pass area in the 1960s.

Traditional Indian oral history places the number as low as six and as high as 100. Captain Powell estimated the dead at 60 and wounded at 120. As the Indians withdrew from the field, so did the soldiers. Following their rescue by Major Smith’s column the surgeon treated the wounded and gave each survivor a drink of whiskey to settle their nerves. The military casualties consisted of three dead in the corral, four dead at the side camp, and two wounded in the corral. These casualties and the day long fight would cause the military to rethink their position at the pineries.  Although the military felt they had won the fight, which gave a great boost to the morale of soldiers on the western plains, they knew the existing corral had its weaknesses. Immediately following the fight Lieutenant Alexander Wishart created a new position south and west of the Wagon Box Fight corral. The new corral was placed further out in the open, giving a better field of fire, and was constructed in a stronger defensive position. A trench was dug around the exterior, and the wagon boxes were placed upon the excavated dirt, creating a formidable barrier to any attack. A new camp site was located to the south of its corral.  To the Indians the Wagon Box fight was also a victory. They had succeeded in destroying the side camp, burned several wagons, captured a large mule herd and killed or wounded several of the enemy. Their goal of harassing the forts had been fulfilled. One lesson learned was that the soldiers had new weapons, and that if the Indians expected to win they would need modern guns. In November 1867, Lieutenant Shurley’s command was attacked on Big Goose Creek and after a day long fight, the Indians were driven off. It is believed that the Indian objective was to capture a mountain howitzer and weapons. This ongoing fighting kept the Bozeman Trail closed to all but military traffic, and the maintenance of the forts became a great expense for the military. Through continuous skirmishing and the husbanding of his resources, Red Cloud was winning his war. The war continued into the summer of 1868 with raids at all three forts along the Bozeman Trail and at the new Fort Fetterman located on the North Platte River. In 1868 treaty negotiators were again ready to discuss the Bozeman Trail.

The First Department organized September 1, 1942, sometimes was called out to fight fired in temperatures as low as thirty degrees below zero.  The water system had been built without expansion joints and occasionally pipes froze solid and cracked. On cold night, the residents kept stoves burning and volunteers took turns walking a fire watch.  Internee Bill Hosokawa was the founding editor of the weekly center newspaper, The Heart Mountain Sentinel, which was edited in the camp and printed in Cody. The Sentinel carried a mimeographed Japanese language supplement. The first issue came out October 24, 1942. Approximately 6000 copies of the Sentinel were published each week. Many copies were sent to friends and relatives outside the camp. The Sentinel sold at first for 3 cents, but the price was lowered to 2 cents when advertisers, such as mail order stores patronized the paper. The internees published the paper with no interference from the Administration.  Between 1942-1945, 185 persons died at Heart Mountain. Some bodies were sent to Great Falls, Montana, for cremation at a cost of $100; others were buried in the camp cemetery. All but five of the bodies were exhumed and removed to the West Coast after the war. The five unclaimed bodies were moved to the Powell Cemetery.

The combination of open sagebrush meadows, steep hills and draws, and trees and shrubs along the river, provide cover and food for the animals. This area is especially important in the winter. Healthy winter ranger is important to give animals a chance to survive the year. Most winter ranges just sustain deer through the winter. If winter range or the migration corridor to winter range is lost to development, it is even harder for deer to survive or raise fawns.  In summer Mule Deer eat mostly grasses and forbs. In fall and winter the leaves and twigs of shrubs are their food source. In this area most of the Mule Deer’s winter diet is made up of sagebrush. This low evergreen shrub pokes up through the snow so deer can get to it. They will also browse on the leaves and tender branches of bitterbrush, sumac, serviceberry, currant and mountain mahogany. Keeping these shrubs healthy in a mixed range environment is important to sustain Mule Deer populations across Wyoming.  The Mule Deer gets its name from the large, mule-like ears. It has a large, whitish rump patch with a short, black-tipped tail. Makes have heavy, up-swept antlers that are equally branched into forked tines. A full grown buck can weigh between 200 and 350 pounds. One of the Mule Deer’s best-known characteristics is it bouncing gait which is known as “stotting.” When it stots, a Mule Deer bounds and lands with all four legs at the same time, so it looks like it’s using a pogo stick. This stiff-legged jump allows the deer to move safely and rapidly across the broken, brushy terrain it lives in.  After breeding in the fall a doe gives birth to one to three fawns in June. The birth weight is 7-9 pounds. The fawn is born with light spots which remained until the fall molt. The first few days of a fawn’s life are critical to its survival. It must remain motionless and rely on protective coloration to avoid predators. If you come across a bedded fawn that appears to be abandoned, please do not touch it! You can contaminate the fawn with your scent so predators can find it. The mother is nearby feeding and will return.","LAT_1":41.25854,"LON_1":-110.9316,"LAT_2":41.2585,"LON_2":-110.9316,"Location":"41.2585, -110.9316","Location_X":-110.9316,"Location_Y":41.2585,"COUNTY":"Uinta","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49916161968_e7f99c135f_z.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":903,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12288518.7919515,5059436.41599179]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":903,"FID":182,"MAMID":"UT0001E.02","SIGNNAME":"Carter Military Road (1881-1884)","LEGEND":"Legend text reads…","LAT_1":41.31851321,"LON_1":-110.3896425,"LAT_2":41.3185,"LON_2":-110.3896,"Location":"41.3185, -110.3896","Location_X":-110.3896,"Location_Y":41.3185,"COUNTY":"Uinta","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49718026037_2f66003160_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":239,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12113696.8193365,5272647.28653849]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":239,"FID":558,"MAMID":"FR0072A.11","SIGNNAME":"The Shady North Facing Slope","LEGEND":"This stream is the Middle Fork of the Popo Agie River, the main drainage of the Popo Agie Watershed.

A watershed, or drainage basin, is the entire land area that channels water via streams, lakes and rivers to major rivers and ultimately the sea. When water runs over this watershed, it picks up sediments and other dissolved substances, indluding pollutants, from the land. This relationship between land and water is critical because it affects water quality. Unpolluted land is vital in providing clean water. Snow and rain falling over 190 square miles flows into the Middle Fork watershed and since much of this land is a protected wilderness area, the water flowing into the Popo Agie River is pure. It supports a wide variety of plants and wildlife as well as provides clean water for people.  Most of the water running in the Popo Agie comes from snow fields high in the Wind River Mountains. These Mountains get enough snow to support active glaciers. Some years the high peaks can receive 200 inches of snow.

The commander, Brevet General Albert Sidney Johnston, did not reach the army until near Fort Bridger. In Utah, the territory was mobilized to resist “invasion.” Plans were made for a “scorched earth” defense.  A brief brush with Utah militiamen convinved acting commander Colonel E.B.

The concentration of wintering bald and golden eagles also benefit from this food source. Preventing big game vehicle collisions helps scavenger avoid the dangers of the highway as they look for food.  Badgers dig for gophers and ground squirrels, while great  horned owls and a variety of hawks hunt from the air. Bobcats chase after cottontail rabbits and porcupines munch on the tree bark. Migrating birds use these areas for rest, cover and feeding stops. All of these creatures utilize his habitat.  People share some of the same habitats with wildlife, thus forming a kinship or interrelationship with wildlife. When we develop the land to meet human needs we must also replace those habitat elements essential to the survival of wildlife. You can help to protect wildlife by adjusting your speeds and watching for animals crossing the highway. By working together we can keep wildlife and motorists safe.

CAMPSITE OF OLD The history of human migration through Hoback Junction is chronicled by the trails laid down by geology. Hoback Junction was a regular bivouac or campsite for hunters and trappers, traders, and gold panners where they regrouped before resuming their treks over “Hunt’s Pass,” now known as Teton Pass. As you retrace these historic routes through the mountains, imagine struggling for days along narrow trails on precipitous cliffs, only to watch in horror as your pack animals tumbled 200 feet into the river below.  WHITEWATER THEN AND NOW Although many attempted to navigate the tumultuous Snake River in dugout canoes in the 1800s, it proved too risky to safely move supplies by this route. Today, in high-tech rafts and kayaks, the Snake River is a whitewater enthusiast’s paradise.  HOW DO I GET TO THE COLUMBIA? Some of the pivotal explorers of this area were searching for a navigable trade route to the Columbia River. Wilson Price Hunt, an investor with the American Fur Company, was leading an expedition from St. Louis when he met the experienced hunters and trappers, John Hoback, Jacob Reznor, and Edward Robinson.  The three men guided Hunt’s group over the Wind River Mountains at Union Pass, down into the Green River Valley, and through the Hoback Canyon. In 1811, they were the first non-natives to journey into Jackson Hole using this route. After parting ways, Hunt’s company continued to Ft. Astoria on the Oregon coast where the Columbia River empties into the Pacific Ocean.  This corridor, having been John Hoback’s favorite hunting ground, implanted his name in western history – exemplified by the Hoback River, Junction, Basin, and Mountain Range.","LAT_1":43.31972,"LON_1":-110.71468,"LAT_2":43.3197,"LON_2":-110.7146,"Location":"43.3197, -110.7146","Location_X":-110.7146,"Location_Y":43.3197,"COUNTY":"Teton","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464058073_e20c4319a9_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":874,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12224579.4924479,5130650.57382154]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":874,"FID":244,"MAMID":"SW0029C.10","SIGNNAME":"An Oasis in the High Desert","LEGEND":"Welcome to Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), where the Green River brings life-sustaining water to the high desert.

South of this spot 400 meters is the location of one of the largest known Clovis mammoth kills in North America. A deep arroyo with steep walls was present when the mammoths were killed. Clovis hunters would stalk a family of mammoths and spear a young animal that was careless enough to wander away from the protection of the family. As the animal became weak from the effects of the wound, it became further removed from the herd and the hunters maneuvered it into the deep arroyo where it could not escape. The hunters needed only to wait for the wound to weaken the animal enough that it could easily be killed. This kind of event was repeated many times over the years. One pile of bones consisted of the left front quarter of a mature female mammoth with bones of other mammoths stacked around it and the skull of a young male mammoth placed on top. This is believed to have been a frozen meat cache that was never utilized and spoiled with the approach of warm weather. Another pile of mammoth bones was probably a similar cache that was utilized. A front quarter of a young mammoth would represent over 500 kilograms of meat. These caches suggest that at least some of the animals were killed during the cold weather months.

Following a battle with U.S. troops on June 17, 1877, near present-day Grangeville, Ida., Chief Joseph and five bands of Nez Perce began a 1,700-mile trek from their homeland.  During the chase, the Nez Perce and the U.S. Army engaged in five more major battles, culminating in the tribe's surrender after the Battle of the Bear Paws in northern Montana on Oct. 3, 1877.

The crumbling tan cliffs visible through the trees are comprised of Madison formation limestone. It is in this thick, soft rock that “The Sinks” are found. The Middle Fork flows down the canyon and into cracks in this limestone where it sinks, disappearing underground until the river reappears in “The Rise,” ¼ mile downstream.  During the 1940s and 50s most of the lower half of Sinks Canyon was purchased by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to preserve and manage important habitats for wildlife. Through a cooperative management agreement with the State Parks and Historical Society the canyon continues to provide critical winter habitat for many animals because it remains relatively snow free and has food, shelter and water available during even the toughest winter months.

Many charcoal kilns were located here.  After trains switched from coal to steam and charcoal was no longer needed, Hilliard Station was closed in 1900. The town lost its population, and the area is now used to raise sheep and cattle, with historic working ranching still dotting the landscape.  Two or three years prior to the coming of the railroad, logging operations had been established in Piedmont to furnish ties for the roadbed. In 1868, track crews began laying the tracks, and test wells for water were dug. Pure, deep-flowing water was found in Piedmont, and the town quickly became populated and was designated as a water and wood refueling station. Settlers built a store, hotel, saloons, school, church and permanent homes. After the Aspen Tunnel bypassed Piedmont, the population dropped to only 35, and the Guild Store and post office were closed in 1940. The buildings were hauled away, but foundations, charcoal kilns and the cemetery remain as evidence of Piedmont’s historic past.

The abundance of deep open water as well as extensive shallow shorelines, ponds, wetlands and riparian areas provides feeding, shelter and nesting areas for many species. Outdoors people of all types come to Boysen and surrounding lakes to hunt, bird watch and enjoy the bounty of Wyoming’s wild birds.  Western Grebe Commonly seen on Boysens water, the Western Grebe has an elaborate mating dance where both male and female raise their torsos out of the water and caress each other with aquatic vegetation held in their long sharp bills. The courtship culminates in a rushing phase where both birds paddle vigorously across the water in an uptight position. They nest in colonies with floating nests built of aquatic vegetation and they feed on small fish and aquatic invertebrates.  Lesser Scaup Also called bluebills for their blue grey bill, the Lesser Scaup is a diving duck that plunges into water to depths of 6 feet for vegetation, crustaceans and aquatic insects. The male Lesser Scaup is black on both ends with grey white sides and a dark head with hints of purple.  Gadwall Gadwalls lack the showy plumage of many other ducks, but they have a striking subtle appearance. The black and white wing patch is a good way to identify these ducks. Males are mostly grey with black hindquarters and females are a mottled brown. Gadwalls are dabbling ducks which feed by tipping forward so that the tail sticks up as it reaches plants on the bottom.  American Wigeon One of the most common western ducks. The voice of the male American Wigeon, a distinct nasal whistle “WHEE, wheew” frequently repeated, is a sound often heard on Wyoming waterways. The Wigeon dabbles for food but often steals plants brought up from the bottom of ponds by diving ducks. The male has a distinct green swipe running back from each eye, a bright white crown and cinnamon breast and flanks. The female has a grayish head and brown underparts.  Canada Goose These magnificent waterfowl are well known for their V-shaped migrating flocks and deep, resonant honking. They chiefly eat marsh vegetation and the stubble left over on farm fields. Typically they nest on islands and the shoreline in nests built of grass and lined with down from the female’s breast.  American White Pelican These gregarious birds usually travel in flocks and nest in colonies. They will work with each other to herd fish into shallow water where they are easier to catch. Pelicans have the largest wing span of any other Rocky Mountain Bird and are often seen wheeling in wide circles in the air. When fishing they often skim low over the water with their bellies nearly touching the waves as they use air currents rising from the water surface to help them glide. Pelicans are very susceptible to pesticides which, along with the draining of wetlands, has caused a sharp drop in their numbers.  Northern Pintail An easy dick to identify because of the male’s distinct long tapering tail feathers. These birds are often seen in flocks of 20-60 birds. They dabble in the shallows for sedges, willows, pondweeds and aquatic insects and amphibians.","LAT_1":43.21935,"LON_1":-108.18056,"LAT_2":43.2193,"LON_2":-108.1805,"Location":"43.2193, -108.1805","Location_X":-108.1805,"Location_Y":43.2193,"COUNTY":"Fremont","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464766812_5dafa5856a_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":565,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12125246.6951801,5571816.26747123]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":565,"FID":1072,"MAMID":"PA0007.92","SIGNNAME":"Eagles Nest Stage Station","LEGEND":"Front side: AMELIA EARHART In Wyoming In memory of the famous world aviatrix.

The site chosen for the hospital was at the southern edge of Evanston on a hill overlooking the town.  The first building, completed in 1887, contained male and female wards, offices and staff living quarters. It burned in 1917. The remaining buildings at the north end of the grounds – all of red brick and of similar architectural styles – were constructed between 1910 and 1932. These buildings are linked by underground tunnels used to transport patients and meals during Wyoming’s cold winters. Tree-studded lawns, created in the late 1910s, were intended to produce a serene landscape for patients. The legislature stipulated that the hospital grounds consist of at least 100 acres so the land could be farmed to produce income to offset expenses. The hospital maintained a large farming operation at the southern end of the campus. Patients and staff raised cattle, sheep, chickens, and hay and vegetable gardens. The farm produced food for the kitchen and, in some years, considerable surplus to sell. In the 1950s and 1960s, new drugs and community-based treatment for the mentally ill greatly reduced the hospital’s patient population. By the beginning of the 21st century, the older buildings were abandoned and operations moved to a new facility at the south end of campus. Today, the peaceful atmosphere of the older campus belies the human suffering that took place here. A poignant reminder of the stigma attached to mental illness is the hospital cemetery that lies across the interstate highway. There, dozens of unmarked graves attest to the lives of those shunned by society and abandoned by their families.

They also prey on small mammals like jackrabbits, snowshoe hares, porcupines, yellow-bellied marmots and other small rodents. In localized parts of the Bighorn Mountains, lion predation on domestic sheep is a chronic problem, thereby necessitating special management strategies and tightly regulated harvest to maintain a delicate balance between man and the cat.  Mountain lions once roamed from northern Canada to the southern tip of South America, but along with colonizing of the Americas by European man, came the persecution and extensive habitat changes which greatly reduced the cat’s range.

Communities sprang up along the line and several with coal deposits or rail facilities survived. Coal mines were opened in the surrounding Bear River Valley in 1868. Dreams of prosperity lured miners from England, Scandinavia, China, and from throughout the United States to settle in \"Wyoming Camp\", which later became Almy. Named for James T. Almy, a clerk for the Rocky Mountain Coal Company and located three miles northwest of Evanston, Allmy was strung out along the Bear River for 5 miles. This particular \"string town\" owed its existence solely to coal mining. Her 4,000 residents suffered more than their share of mining tragedies. On March 4, 1881, the first mine explosion west of the Mississippi to claim lives, killed 38 men in just one of many serious disasters to strike Almy. In January of 1886, 13 more died and on March 20, 1895 the third worst mine explosion in Wyoming history, claimed the lives of 61 men. The State Coal Mine Inspector determined the Almy mines \"among the most dangerous in the state\". Finally, in 1900 the mines were closed by the Union Pacific due to labor troubles and explosions.

Initiatives and legislation during the previous forty years had restricted or prohibited Japanese immigration, land ownership and U.S. naturalization. Still nearly 127,000 Japanese Americans were living in the United States mostly in California, Oregon and Washington. Immediately after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japan, a mandatory curfew was imposed, first on Japanese aliens and then on Japanese American citizens and all were required to carry identification. On February 19, 1942 President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 ordering the exclusion of all persons of Japanese descent, alien or citizen within designated areas of Washington, Oregon, California and Arizona for reasons of military necessity.  Persons of Japanese American descent were instructed to report to assigned assembly centers, until internment camps could be built. They were given only a few days to secure or dispose of their land, houses and possessions. They were allowed to take 100 pounds per person or what they could carry.  There were sixteen assembly centers, ten Justice Department camps, six citizen isolation centers and ten internment camps. The internment camps were located in the states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, California, Idaho and Arkansas and operated from 1942-1946.  The Heart Mountain Relocation Center opened in 1942 and closed in November 1945 and all persons were removed, given twenty-five dollars and a rail pass to the destination of their choice. Former internees suffered great hardships during the years after World War II. The former internees often met with hostility, acute housing shortages, loss of jobs and businesses and were forced to start life anew. Recovery came slowly.  The Commission On Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians concluded the exclusion, expulsion and incarceration of Japanese Americans in World War II was not justified by military necessity, as the government had claimed, instead, the decision was based on race prejudice, war hysteria, and failure of political leadership.  The internment of Japanese Americans is unique to the period of World War II; however, it is of disturbing relevance today when groups of people continue to be singled out.  *The walking tour is on land owned by the United States Department of Interior and operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation.

The Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation is established to memorialize and educate the public about the significance of the historical events surrounding the internment of Japanese Americans during WW II, and especially the experience of Japanese Americans who were interned at the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Heart Mountain, Wyoming.  The walking tour presents a partial picture of the events that took place in the War Relocation Center at Heart Mountain, Wyoming. The trail is approximately 1000 feet in length and is situated in the area of the relocation center that originally housed the Administration buildings.

Now, these magnificent animals are found in only a fraction of their historic range. Human expansion, disease, market hunting and fire suppression all contributed to the decline of bighorn sheep populations and their habitat. Fortunately, management actions taken by state and federal agencies, tribal governments, and wildlife conservation groups have restored wild sheep to many of their former ranges.  The Absaroka Mountains in northwest Wyoming, including Wind River Canyon, support nearly 80 percent of the bighorn sheep in Wyoming. During most of the 20th century, however, Wind River Canyon supported relatively few bighorn sheep. In 1995, 43 bighorn sheep from Whiskey Basin near Dubois were released into Wind River Canyon on the Wind River Reservation, to repopulate this historic range. Bighorn sheep now can be seen on the rocky cliffs, the bunchgrass-covered slopes, and along the river’s edge throughout the Wind River Canyon.  Bighorn sheep prefer and depend on open, rough country with high-visibility to detect and avoid predators. Fire, whether naturally occurring or ignited by managers under very specific environmental conditions, plays a major role in maintaining and enhancing habitats throughout wild sheep range.

Vetter – 1855-1892","LEGEND":"Phillip Henry Vetter was born February 7, 1855 near Woodstock, Shenandoah County, Virginia. He was killed by a grizzly bear on the Greybull River in Wyoming in 1892.  A few years after the Civil War, Phillip’s family came West by wagon train and settled in the Wind River Country near Lander, Wyoming Territory.  Through the 1880’s, Phillip Vetter pursued the occupation of market hunter and trapper. About 1890 he moved over to the Greybull River above Meeteetse, Wyoming. Here he built a log cabin and continued his hunting and trapping.  On September 1, 1892, Vetter left a note at his cabin which said, “Jake, if you come to get your horses, I’m going down to the river after some bear.”  A week or so later John Corbett, an old buffalo hunter, was riding over to John Gleavers on Wood River. When he was near Vetter’s cabin, black clouds threatened a heavy rain. Corbett decided to wait out the storm in shelter with Vetter.  He rode up to the cabin. The door stood open. Inside, Corbett found Vetter’s body on the floor. Dishes from Vetter’s last meal stood unwashed on the dusty table. The storm was forgotten. Corbett jumped on his horse and raced to the Gleaver ranch.  The two men returned and sought to piece the story together. They found Vetter’s neatly written note to Jake. In contrast, scribbled on the edge of a newspaper in Vetter’s handwriting, in what they believed was his own blood, were several terse messages. The first said something about a battle with a grizzly bear. A later notation said, “Should go to Franc’s but too weak.” Vetter’s handwriting grew shakier. “It’s getting dark. I’m smothering.” The final message read, “I’m dying.”  One of Vetter’s arms had been badly mangled and his chest was crushed. He had tried unsuccessfully to stop the flow of blood.  The men walked down to the river to look for more clues. Near the stream the men found a water bucket and Vetter’s hat, and not far away was his rifle. A shell had jammed in the chamber. On the ground lay two empty casings.  The wounded bear had mauled him severely before leaving him for dead. Vetter was able to drag himself back to his cabin where he wrote his death message in his own blood. Thirty-seven year old Phillip Vetter died alone, far from help.  Corbett and Gleaver built a casket of rough boards with timbers hewn from logs for a lid. Vetter was buried on upper river bank, near his cabin. A slab of sandstone with the inscription “P.H. Vetter – 1892” was placed at the grave.","LAT_1":44.51517,"LON_1":-109.10531,"LAT_2":44.5151,"LON_2":-109.1053,"Location":"44.5151, -109.1053","Location_X":-109.1053,"Location_Y":44.5151,"COUNTY":"Park","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49782280762_82b16edbbb_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":608,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12099864.5488412,5591892.12917423]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":608,"FID":1103,"MAMID":"PA0021.03","SIGNNAME":"Shoshone Project Story - Project Overview","LEGEND":"The Shone Project is  located in a desert-like valley surrounded by mountains.

Subsidence occurs when a mine roof collapses, making a sinkhole on the land surface. These cave-ins endanger human and animal life through the potential for injury or entrapment, and can render land unusable. Sometimes subsidence damages buildings, roads, and other properties. These subsidence features can disrupt or divert surface and groundwater, affecting water availability, and sometimes worsening underground mine stability. In this vicinity, several historic underground coal fires have been burning for over a century. Such fires start from natural or manmade causes, including past mining activities, wildfires, or even through spontaneous combustion. Underground coal fires can pollute the air with toxic gas and smoke emissions, and many emit deadly concentrations of carbon monoxide. These fires can also cause under-ground explosions by igniting methane or other explosive gasses.  KLEENBURN RECREATION AREA In 2009, AML, Sheridan County, and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department partnered to reclaim hazardous conditions left from historic coal mining activity. This resulted in today’s Kleenburn Recreation Area. The success of this project was nationally recognized with the 2011 Western Regional Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Award by the U.S. Department of Interior Office of Surface Mining.

Other area AML projects include repairing subsidence, abating underground mine fires and waste coal, closing dangerous mine entrances, reducing dangerous pit highwalls, and fixing flooded mine pits.   The Wyoming Abandoned Mine Land Program (AML) works to reclaim areas impacted by past mining. Before current mining laws required mine operators to restore the disturbed lands, many miners simply walked away from mines, leaving behind hazards and environmental damage. AML’s mission is to mitigate impacts of past mining, alleviate public safety hazards, and repair environmental degradation from abandoned mines of all types.","LAT_1":44.904983,"LON_1":-107.012194,"LAT_2":44.9049,"LON_2":-107.0121,"Location":"44.9049, -107.0121","Location_X":-107.0121,"Location_Y":44.9049,"COUNTY":"Sheridan","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49813296633_223f03d36e_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":943,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12278224.4663807,5066325.92739287]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":943,"FID":196,"MAMID":"UT0016.02","SIGNNAME":"Lyman Beehive Monument","LEGEND":"No text","LAT_1":41.36497882,"LON_1":-110.297167,"LAT_2":41.3649,"LON_2":-110.2971,"Location":"41.3649, -110.2971","Location_X":-110.2971,"Location_Y":41.3649,"COUNTY":"Uinta","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464774197_7240d8c116_z.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":196,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12064851.6746799,5315882.84727923]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":196,"FID":736,"MAMID":"FR0035.94","SIGNNAME":"Trappers Rendezvous Monument","LEGEND":"In memory of the trappers, traders and explorers, who established the rendezvous at the junction of the Little and Big Wind Rivers.

However, recent studies indicate that Bright was the only author of the suffrage bill, although he may have received some urging from his wife Julia and some help from Edward Lee, Secretary of the Territory. Morris probably held court in the county building near the center of town.  Today, Esther Morris is recognized as the nation’s first woman justice of the peace.

Over the years many people recognized the unique beauty of the canyon. As it grew in popularity, various public and private groups realized it could be overwhelmed or developed, destroying what attracted many to Sinks Canyon in the first place.  In 1891 the upper half of the canyon became part of the Shoshone National Forest system. Growth below the canyon prompted the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to begin buying land in the canyon to save wildlife habitat. The canyon had long been known as important range for many animals, with the sunny south facing slope a particularly critical winter range for mule deer and bighorn sheep. The Game and Fish also wanted to protect the Popo Agie fishery and ensure fisherman access to the river.  In 1939 and again in 1953 the Game and Fish bought large portions of the canyon. A 1939 editorial in the Wyoming State Journal said, “For the purchase price of $2.50 an acre the state owns a natural wonder which in Colorado would be fenced off and fifty cents charged to see it.” In 1963 Pacific Power and Light donated the land it owned around the Rise for a park. In 1970 the City of Lander, the Wyoming Game and Fish and the state of Wyoming agreed to develop the canyon for recreational use while preserving the wildlife habitat and unspoiled beauty of the area. In 1971 Wyoming Governor Hathaway signed the bill approving the creation of Sinks Canyon State Park. The plan for the park read in part: “Within the canyon walls are found unspoiled symbols representative of the best of Wyoming. The mountains, the river, the fish and wildlife; sage, wildflowers, aspen and pine trees, a rugged country of tranquil quiet under blue skies. The development of park facilities must accent and enhance these values. To overwhelm them with chrome plated campgrounds and concession stands would be unwise.”  Today Sinks Canyon is managed by the Wyoming Department of State Parks and Cultural Resources, and continues to offer special experiences to thousands who visit each year.

Built almost exclusively with manual labor and hand tools, the cross-country railroad took only four years to construct. Large numbers of workers were needed to survey and grade the bed, and lay down the ties and rails. Union Pacific chief engineer, General Greenville Dodge, made use of a geological feature called the Gangplank, located 15 miles to the east, as an easy grade to route the railroad across the Laramie Mountains.  SHAPING A NATION:  Construction of the Transcontinental Railroad led to settlements sprouting up along its path, an increase in population, and the creation of the Wyoming Territory. The driving of the golden spike at Promontory Summit in Utah on May 10, 1869 ushered in a new era in America. “Once the rails were joined at Promontory,” wrote author T.H. Watkins, “we began for the first time, truly, to think of ourselves as a continental nation.” With the completion of the railroad, passengers and freight were able to make the journey across America in a matter of days, instead of the months it had taken by wagon or ship.  SHERMAN, WYOMING:  Sherman, Wyoming was a railroad town that existed about a quarter mile from the Monument between 1867-1901. Sherman had a Wells Fargo express office, a newspaper, a clothing store, two false-fronted hotels, and a bar. The town’s timber mill produced thousands of ties for the railroad. In time, the Union Pacific moved the tracks three miles south to a lower elevation with less snow, bypassing the dangerous single-track bridge at Dale Creek. With the relocation of the railroad tracks, Sherman soon became a ghost town.  THE DALE CREEK TRESTLE:  The bridge at Dale Creek, about two miles west of Sherman, presented Union Pacific construction engineers with one of their most difficult challenges. At 706 feet in length, it was the longest and highest bridge along the Union Pacific Railroad. The wooden trestle was 125 feet above the valley floor and swayed dramatically in the wind as trains crossed. Engineers had to slow a train to four mph before crossing to prevent the strong Wyoming winds from blowing empty boxcars off the bridge and into the rocky ravine below.","LAT_1":41.15783,"LON_1":-110.85077,"LAT_2":41.1578,"LON_2":-110.8507,"Location":"41.1578, -110.8507","Location_X":-110.8507,"Location_Y":41.1578,"COUNTY":"Uinta","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49717412131_85712f44f4_m.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":986,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12288574.1733982,5059431.49366275]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":986,"FID":180,"MAMID":"UT0031A.13","SIGNNAME":"Post Trader’s House","LEGEND":"Judge Carter began building his home in 1858 and continually added onto it as his family grew and his status improved.

Water diverted from Willow Creek turned the large waterwheel to provide power. A drive shaft connected to the wheel rotated a series of cogwheels that in turn dragged stones around the basic, crushing the ore.  Miners hauled ore to this arrastra, where it was placed into the basic to be crushed. Once the ore was broken up into smaller pieces, the operator would pour mercury into the basic, continue grinding, rinse out the rock fines, add more ore, and repeat the process. After the ore had been pulverized, the amalgam – gold captured within the mercury – was carefully removed from the low places and crevices in the arrastra floor. The amalgam was then heated and distilled to recover the gold, and the mercury was saved for reuse.  SPANISH ORIGIN Arrastras were widely used throughout the Mediterranean region since Phoenician times. The Spanish introduced this technology to the New World in the 1500s. The term “arrastra” comes from the Spanish word arrastre, meaning to drag along the ground.

These caravans brought the area’s first tourist, William Drummond Stewart, its first artist, Alfred Jacob Miller, and the West’s first white women, Eliza Spaulding and Narcissa Whitman.\n\nIn his first trip exploring the West in 1842, John Charles Fremont, guided by mountain man Kit Carson, “nooned” here the week before climbing Fremont Peak. \n\nFrederick Lander used the crossing in 1857-1859, while surveying and building the first federally funded road, the “Lander Cutoff” of the Oregon Trail. His route followed the old Indian trail from South Pass, but from this point cut a new track west across the desert. Water, forage and firewood made Buckskin Crossing a favored campsite for tens of thousands of emigrants along the Cutoff preparing to cross the basin to the Green River.  At least nine emigrant graves lie in the grassy area below this sign.  Remnants of the Lander Trail can be seen across the river, coming down the hill just to the left of today’s road.\n\nAccording to local legend, the crossing was named in the late 1800s for a hunter and trapper called “Buckskin Joe,” who lived in a cabin near here with his wife and daughter.\n\nAll land below this hill and along the river is private property.

Make it wide enough to turn this damn team of mules around in.” (Henry “Sixteen Mule Team” Johnson)  Thermopolis was named for the nearby hot springs by combining the Greek words thermo (hot) and polis (city). In 1896, the Shoshone and Arapaho sold a ten-mile square of land at the northeast corner of their reservation. These lands included the hot mineral springs (Bah-gue-wana), reportedly the largest in the world, and the site of today’s town. When the treaty was ratified the next year, settlers from the nearby small towns of Andersonville and Old Thermopolis promptly picked up and moved to their new townsite.  Freight teams transported all goods in and out of the isolated town from distant railheads. As soon as freighter Henry Johnson learned of the new town, he requested a street wide enough to turn his team of sixteen mules. The town founders and surveyors honored his request, and the unique street of Broadway was laid out 150 feet wide. A treacherous stage road connected the young town to the railhead at Casper by way of Copper Mountain over Birdseye Pass. But when the first Burlington engine steamed into town from the north in 1910, the freighting era was gone forever.  Historic photos of West Broadway from the 1920s show a landscaped median gracing the middle of the street with room for parking and two lanes of traffic on both sides, but by the 1930s the center strip was graveled and used for parking. In the early 1950s, a portion of Broadway once again featured a median with grass and trees.

In winter they migrate to lower elevations where the snow is lighter and food easier to get. Sinks Canyon is critical winter habitat for Mule Deer. Healthy winter range is important to give animals a chance to survive the year. Most winter ranges just sustain the deer through winter. If winter range or the migration corridor to winter range is lost to development, it is even harder for the deer to survive or raise fawns.  In summer mule deer eat mostly grasses and forbs. In fall and winter the leaves and twigs of shrubs are their food source. In Sinks Canyon 98% of the Mule deer’s winter diet is made up of sagebrush and bitterbrush. These two low shrubs pole up through the snow so deer can get to them. They also browse on the leaves and tender branches of sumac, snowberry, serviceberry, currant and buffalo berry.  Keeping these shrubs healthy in a mixed forest environment is important to sustain Mule Deer populations in Sinks Canyon and across Wyoming. Fire is a key tool to keep forests healthy. Fire was the main force that formed the landscape for many of the wildlife we cherish today. Aspen stands need a fire every 80 to 100 years to regenerate as do other plants.  Mule Deer thrive in early successional habitats where forbs and younger shrubs dominate. These environments are not as stable as mature forests and rely on fire or other disturbances to regenerate them. If they are not disturbed they eventually become stable plant communities dominated by trees and large shrubs. Tree dominated habitats offer shelter but little food for deer. It is important to provide Mule Deer with a mosaic of habitats that provide food, cover and water.  The mixed terrain in Sinks Canyon is good habitat for Mule Deer – the combination of steep hills, draws, thick brush and open forests provide cover and food for the animals.  The Mule Deer gets its name from the large mule-like ears. It has a large, whitish rump patch with a short, black-tipped tail. Males have heavy, up-swept antlers that are equally branched into forked tines. A full grown buck can weigh between 200 and 250 pounds.  One of the Mule Deer’s best-known characteristics is its bouncing gait which is known as “stotting. When it stots, a Mule Deer bounds and lands with all four legs at the same time, so it looks like it’s using a pogo stick. This stiff-legged jump allows the deer to move safely and rapidly across the broken, bushy terrain it lives in. Mule Deer can walk, trot and gallop equally well.  After breeding in the fall a doe gives birth to one to three (usually two) fawns in June. The birth weight is 7-9 pounds. The Fawn is born with light spots which are retained until the fall molt. The first few days of a fawn’s life are critical to its survival. It must remain motionless and rely on protective coloration to avoid predators. If you come across a bedded fawn that appears to be abandoned, please do not touch it! You contaminate the fawn with your scent so predators can find it. The Mother is nearby feeding and will return.

The Sweetwater’s wide floodplain, enhanced by the irrigated and naturally occurring wet meadows, supports wildlife as large as the 1,000 pound moose and as small as the ¼ ounce pygmy shrew. The vegetation zone in the river’s floodplain is called riparian habitat. Willows are often dominant woody vegetation in Wyoming’s riparian habitats. Willows provide food and cover for moose in winter, food and dam building materials for the beaver, and streamside shade and insects for fish.  Willow roots also help stabilize streambanks. Without stabilizing vegetation, the streambanks erode and spring floods cut deeper into the riverbed. This accelerates erosion and affects wildlife.

Stratigraphy, Karst topography and glacial geology are all seen in the canyon.  The uppermost cliffs are Tensleep Sandstone. These massive cliffs are from the Pennsylvanian age (280-310 million years ago). Tensleep sandstone is a porous quartz sandstone which makes it an important all bearing formation. The oil occupies the space between the grains of sand. The red and black streaking on the cliffs are oxides of iron and manganese and are called “desert varnish.” The next formation is hard to see from the canyon floor because it weathers rapidly to a grass and tree covered slope. This is the Amsden formation, a reddish-orange group of sandstone and shale. Amsden is also from the Pennsylvanian age, but is older.  The most recent geologic phenomenon in Sinks Canyon were the glaciers. Glacial erratic are common. These are granite boulders carried down from higher in the mountains and deposited as the glaciers receded. Moraines are found throughout the canyon. Moraines are long piles of various size boulders. Glaciers act as giant bulldozers, lucking rocks from the canyon walls as the glacier carves its way down the canyon. This debris is carried by the glacier until it stops and melts.  Big Horn dolomite is visible further up the canyon. Dolomite is similar to limestone, but is harder and more resistant to erosion. This gives it massive “clean looking” faces when exposed. The dolomite is a popular rock climbing area in Sinks Canyon. Big Horn dolomite is from the Ordovician period (425 to 500 million years ago) and often contains fossils such as corals, brachiopods and trilobites.  The jagged-looking formation that the Sinks is in is called Madison Limestone. This soft rock is from the Mississippian period (325-345 million years ago). Limestone is easily eroded by carbonic acid, a weak, naturally forming acid created by the combination of water and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This erosion gives the formation the many pockets, sink holes, outcrops and caves and is called “Karst topography.","LAT_1":42.75008,"LON_1":-108.80775,"LAT_2":42.75,"LON_2":-108.8077,"Location":"42.7500, -108.8077","Location_X":-108.8077,"Location_Y":42.75,"COUNTY":"Fremont","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49945553763_fa98a99c55_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":958,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12338929.5450585,5032945.62028131]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":958,"FID":41,"MAMID":"UT0020G.11","SIGNNAME":"Flumes, Kilns, Logging Industry","LEGEND":"Early day timber cutting in the headwater drainages of the Bear River occurred between 1870 and 1900.

The saw logs that supplied the mill were floated from the forest down the Bear River during early spring runoff. Thirty-two charcoal kilns were constructed in the Hilliard and Piedmont areas. The charcoal manufactured from the kilns was shipped to smelters in Utah and Colorado for use by the railroad.  Railroad ties were an early product of timber cutting and flumes. The decline of the charcoal industry began with the use of coke in smelters and a fall in prices. Native lumber was replaced by higher quality lumber from the Northwest.

During the summer, a few ducks and Canada geese will nest and raise their young along the lake’s limited shoreline habitat. Ducks, like mallards, teal, widgeon, shoveler, gadwall and redheads are most often seen during spring and fall migration. Shorebirds are also common in the summertime and often walk this same shoreline in search of food. Explore the area, and you may see an avocet, black-necked stilt, killdeer, lesser yellowlegs or Wilson’s phalarope. Viewing opportunities are usually best here during migration.  Alkali Lake gets its name from the extremely high concentration of soluble alkali metals, especially sodium. The lake’s water falls as precipitation seeps in as groundwater and flows in as surface runoff in the spring or after a rain. As the water level drops from evaporation, the alkalinity increases. Fish cannot survive in this water, however small invertebrates, such as fairy shrimp thrive here. During migration, waterbirds need places like Alkali Lake to rest and refuel before continuing on their journey.

The Utah War (1857-1858) was the result of a lack of communication between the U.S. Government and the Utah Territory concerning Brigham Young’s power as governor of Utah and as head of the Church of Latter Day Saints. To resolve this conflict of interest, President Buchanan appointed a new governor, Alfred Cumming. However, fearing Utah’s citizens would not calmly accept the replacement of Young, Buchanan canceled mail service to Utah and send out a military force of 2,500 men to safely escort Cumming to Salt Lake City. Captain Lew Simpson, for which the site is named, and his troops, were part of this military force send to Utah on the Oregon Trail.  Upon notification of the approaching troops, Young and other Mormon leaders assumed, because they had not been notified of the administrative changes, that the army’s intent was religious persecution. Young deployed the Utah Militia, also known as the Nauvoo Legion, to slow the U.S. troops.  In October 1857, a wagon train under the command of Captain Simpson was surrounded by the Utah Militia and forced to surrender its wagons. The Militia, led by Lot Smith, released the livestock and burned all but one supply wagon, resulting in damages estimated at over $85,000. In addition to the incident at Simpson’s Hollow, the Militia burned two other wagon trains, forcing the entire army to winter near the recently burned Fort Bridger.  In the spring, Thomas L. Kane, long-time friend of the Mormons, negotiated a settlement that allowed U.S. troops to peacefully enter Salt Lake City.

These mines were opened by the coal mining company of the Union Pacific Railroad. Here, where the tipple now stands, the first coal loading facility was constructed in 1912. The stone foundations for the earlier wooden tipple are still evident east of the metal tipple. The tipple you see today was completed in 1936 and still contains machinery from when it was in operation. Few tipples remain from the era when coal was king. Modern mining methods and a shift to gasoline motors and diesel powered locomotives made underground coal mining too expensive to compete in the energy market while using the technology of the early twentieth century. Tipples such as this one were torn down and the equipment sold as salvage. In Wyoming, only the Reliance tipple remains as an example of a large industrial coal handling facility. It is a silent marker of a by-gone age and serves as a tribute to the miners and their families who worked to establish homes in southwest Wyoming and to the men who lost their lives in the coal mines of Sweetwater County.

Johnson-Fermelia Co., Inc. (Wyoming Centennial seal)   SECOND SIGN The Rock Springs Uplift and Coal Mining The town of Reliance and the nearby coal mines are located in what geologists call the Rock Springs Uplift. This region was uplifted by geological forces that caused the coal, formed during the Cretaceous Period (63 million to 90 million years ago), to be exposed in sandstone ridges. The first explorer to note the presence of coal in this area was Howard Stansbury. Traveling along Bitter Creek to the south of here in 1850, Stansbury and his companions wrote that coal could be found all along the creek. In 1868 the Union Pacific Railroad was constructed near Stansbury's route. With the completion of the railroad, coal mining began in earnest. Between 1867 and 1869 mines were opened at Blairtown, Rock Springs, Hallville, Van Dyke, and Point of Rocks. All of these mines were located along the Bitter Creek Valley that Stansbury had once traveled. Not until the turn of the century would large mines be operated outside this valley. For almost 100 years Union Pacific's mining efforts centered around the Rock Springs Uplift. Rock Springs coal became synonymous with high quality. Coal from the mines in the area was used to fire railroad locomotives throughout the West. As the demand for Wyoming coal increased, new mines were needed. In 1910 the mines at Reliance were opened to help meet this need. Railroad tracks were laid to the new mines, and a town was constructed to house the miners. Mine facilities and a host of commercial buildings were built by and owned by the Union Pacific Coal Company, thus, Reliance was a company town. Everything from the new electric lights to the candy counter in the company store belonged to what was known as the \"U.P.\" Union Pacific recruited men from around the world to work in their Reliance mines. For example, people from Finland, Japan, Italy, Australia, Slovenia, and England all lived in Reliance. In having foreign-born families living and working together, Reliance was not alone. It was widely held that fifty-three different languages were spoken in the early day Union Pacific coal towns located in southern Wyoming. Reliance, like the other coal towns of the Rock Springs Uplift, boasted a colorful blend of ethnic groups brought together to mine coal.

This area may be one of the most important areas for wintering elk along the west slope of the Big Horns. Winter counts of the habitat area have often exceeded 1,000 elk. Situated between the rugged, steep-sided canyons of Wed Medicine Lodge and Dry Medicine Lodge Creeks, the gently rolling, wind blown slopes of the habitat area constitute ideal winter range. South facing slopes that remain snow free for much of the winter provide feeding areas while the timbered draws and canyons offer protection from weather. Wildlife managers have used prescribed (planned) fire to improve winter habitat for elk by burning specific areas of heavy sagebrush in order to provide a greater quantity and quality of desired forage such as grasses.

Stilwell, better known as “Comanche Jack,” was born in Kansas in 1850 and served on the frontier during his youth as a scout and hunter. He is best known for his heroic deeds at the Battle of Beechers Island in September of 1868.  August 1868 were trying times in Kansas Territory as bands of marauding Sioux and Cheyenne were killing many settlers in what is now western Kansas and eastern Colorado.  It was well known that the regular troops had little effect against the hit-and-run tactics of the Indians.  On August 24, 1868 General Sheridan ordered Colonel G.A. Forsyth to enlist “50 first class hardy frontiersmen” and arm them with the new “Spender Carbine,” a repeating cartridge rifle that could fire nine shots without reloading. These guns were far superior to the single shot muzzle loading guns that had been in use for many years. The ranks were soon filled, and among the volunteers was 18 year old Jack Stilwell, described as “a youth of six feet three or more, short of years but long on frontier lore.”  Forsyth’s contingent left Fort Hayes on August 29, 1868, and headed north-westward into the Indian country. On the morning of September 16, the scouts crossed the trail of a large band of Indians. That evening Forsyth’s party camped along the north bank of the Arikaree Fork of the Republican River. Before dawn some young warriors tried to steal some of the scouts horses. Then, shortly after dawn, the entire horizon seemed filled with mounted and unmounted Indians. It is said that Jack Stilwell pointed to a small island in the river and the officers and scouts made a mad dash for it. Almost immediately, approximately six hundred Cheyenne and Sioux warriors began their charge down the slope toward the island. The scouts killed their horses for breastworks and dug into the sand behind them. Then, like a cyclone, the massive screaming force hit the island. When the first warriors were with twenty-five yards of the scouts, they opened fire with the new repeating guns. Horses and men fell in the first volley. Many of which rolled over the defenders of the island. Colonel Forsyth’s leg was shattered by a bullet, Lt. Beecher and Surgeon Moore were fatally wounded while others received lesser wounds.  The warriors, surprised by the rapid fire of the new guns, changed their tactics. They began riding in and swerving off as they fired, while others sniped at the defenders from hidden positions. After the first day of fighting Forsyth realized that without food and medical supplies their situation was hopeless. That night Jack Stilwell and Pierre Trudeau volunteered to try to sneak through the Indians and bring help from Fort Wallace, 125 miles away. Everyone feared that they would not make it. But after several close calls and a great deal of hardship, they did make it. On the 25th Jack Stilwell arrived with the 10th Cavalry and saved the survivors on the island.  After the Beecher Island battle, Stilwell remained a scout for the army for a length of time. Later in life he became a deputy United States Marshall in Oklahoma Territory, where he killed and captured several outlaws. Later he became the Police Judge at El Reno, Oklahoma and in the mid 1890’s became a government cattle inspector for the Comanche Agency at Anadarko, Oklahoma. After that, Stilwell became a United States Commissioner and the Master of the Masonic Lodge at Erwin Springs, Oklahoma.  Through the influence of his friend Buffalo Bill Cody, he came to Cody, Wyoming in 1897 where he took care of Cody’s interests while he was away with the Wild West Show. Jack Stilwell had a small ranch on the South Fork of the Shoshone River, near Cody, Wyoming and died, from a sudden illness, in Cody in 1903.","LAT_1":44.51517,"LON_1":-109.10531,"LAT_2":44.5151,"LON_2":-109.1053,"Location":"44.5151, -109.1053","Location_X":-109.1053,"Location_Y":44.5151,"COUNTY":"Park","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49782284062_c400512147_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":775,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11940541.5777974,5602160.95645678]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":775,"FID":1107,"MAMID":"SH0012.92","SIGNNAME":"First Woman Mayor in Wyoming Information Sign","LEGEND":"FIRST WOMAN MAYOR IN WYOMING  [etching of a bust of lady mayor] \"Mrs. Susan Wissler, on May 9, 1911, was elected mayor of Dayton, Wyoming, then a community of about 175 people.

The aromatic silver-grey sagebrush is the most common plant seen. It is a tall wintergreen shrub. Since it often sticks up through the snow in the winter, it is a critical food source for Mule deer and Pronghorn Antelope. The most common type of sagebrush in Sinks Canyon is Big Sage. Often growing alongside sagebrush is bitterbrush, an important wildlife food, rabbitrbrush and greasewood.  Wildflowers such as Indian Paintbrush, lupine, penstemon, buckwheat and the Sego lily make a bright splash of color among the sage. Most of these plants are eaten by wildlife or birds.  Many birds make a home in sagebrush habitat including Prairie Falcons, Burrowing owls, Sage Grouse and Loggerhead Shrike.  Antelope and deer eat sage as do rabbits, and some birds.  Sagebrush meadows are the home to Prairie dogs, badgers, ground squirrels, the endanger Black-footed ferret and coyotes. Loss of sagebrush habitat threatens all of these species. Sagebrush habitat is one of the most ecologically varied and important ecosystems in North America, yet it has dwindled over 75% in size and quality and continues to be threatened. Real beauty exists here for those that seek it and it is our responsibility to help preserve this habitat and wildlife for future generations.  The Least Chipmunk is the most commonly seen chipmunk in the west and runs with its tail held straight upward.  Indian Paintbrush grows in sagebrush meadows and can be bright red, orange or yellow in color.  The Prairie Rattlesnake is an important predator of mice and other rodents.  Scarlet Gilia is also known as skyrocket. It can grow up to three feet tall and is pollinated by hummingbirds and moths.  The Sego lily is a beautiful white flower seen in early summer.

In order to make travel slightly more civilized, Wells Fargo posted rules for stagecoach etiquette.  Not everyone could manage a stagecoach. Drivers had to control four to six horses galloping at perilous speeds over treacherous frontier roads, where any miscue could hurl a coach hundreds of feet down a steep canyon. Some drivers were swaggering, rough-spoken men, but in spite of these manners, nearly all of them were courteous, personable, and willing to recall their many exciting experiences.  Historian George Bancroft wrote: “The average stage driver was above all, lord in his way, the captain of his raft, the fear of timid passengers, the administration of stable boys, and the trusted agend of his employer.”  Stagecoach Etiquette *Abstinence from liquor is requested but, if you must drink, share the bottle. To do otherwise makes your appear selfish and unneighborly. *Buffalo robes are provided for your comfort in colder weather. Hogging robes will not be tolerated and the offender will be made to ride with the driver. *Don’t snore loudly while sleeping or use your fellow passenger’s shoulder for a pillow; he or she may not understand and friction may result. *In the event of runaway horses, remain calm. Leaping from the coach in panic will leave you injured, at the mercy of the elements, hostile Indians and hungry coyotes. *Gents guilty of unchivalrous behavior toward lady passengers will be put off the stage.

The Western Union and Missouri Telegraph Company informed Colorado residents that if they would subscribe $20,000 worth of stock in the enterprise, the company would run the line through Denver, otherwise, the emigrant and mail route over South Pass would be followed. The support in Colorado did not come, and the telegraph was pushed across Wyoming in the summer and fall of 1861. The lack of trees along much of the western route posed a considerable construction problem, but in the fall of 1861, the transcontinental telegraph carried the first message from New York to San Francisco.

Known as “Smiths Fork on the Bear River” to fur trappers and pioneers. Cokeville acquired its permanent name after the discovery of near-by coal deposits that produced coke, an intensive burning, virtually smokeless product.  The Mormon Church sent the first permanent settlers to the area in 1874 to found a community. Sylvanus Collett and Robert Gee arrived with their families at the Smiths Fork River, soon to be followed by the John Bourne family. The men trapped, hunted, and traded hides, furs, and extra meat fur supplies in Evanston, Wyoming, about 70 miles south. The trip to Evanston was arduous; winter journeys were sometimes made on the frozen Bear River. The launching of the Oregon Short Line in 1881 made travel easier. The railroad stimulated trade, changing the center of the main settlement to the vicinity of the tracks.  Prior to 1908, Cokeville consisted of two saloons, a hotel, a general store, and boarding houses. In the next nine years it incorporated and added a state bank, a newspaper, a water system, and electric lighting. In 1922, Cokeville made national headlines when Ethel Stoner became mayor and two other females won seats on the town council. The women ran on a law enforcement ticket, although, once in office, they found local police disinclined to enforce Prohibition laws then in force. After U.S. Highway 30 was commissioned through the town in 1926 then surfaced with oil in 1935, Cokeville found itself on a major cross-country route.

From the tall crowns of cottonwoods to the tiny multicolored lichen on the granite boulders, Sinks Canyon is the home to many interesting and unusual plants.  Lichens – There are over 1000 different kinds of lichens in the Rocky Mountains, and they are among the most colorful and interesting lifeforms around. Lichen are a fungus and an algae growing in a symbiotic relationship on a solid surface such as a rock. Algae are photosynthesizers and supply the fungus with carbohydrates, vitamins and proteins. In return, the fungus protects the algae from the elements. The lichen is byproduct of this relationship. Most lichens are “microlichens,” orange, grey or green crusts on rocks. Since the lichen is actually eating the rock, over time they held erode it. Bighorn sheep will eat lichens.  Showy milkweed – A tall grayish-green plant that oozes a stick white sap if it is hurt. The sap contains poisonous glycosides. The plant grow in colonies and is often seen in disturbed areas. In the summer it has clusters of pinkish-white flowers. It develops large hairy pods full of seeds late in the summer.  Prickly Pear Cactus – This low growing cactus is widespread across the west. It grows in dry, gravelly soil. In the summer if there is enough moisture it has bright yellow flower with thin overlapping petals. The fleshy stems are edible, although not very tasty, but the many sharp spines are difficult to remove.  Narrowleaf Cottonwood – A tall, water-loving deciduous tree that grows in the riparian zone in the canyon. As the tree ages the grey bark gets rough and deeply furrowed. The leaves are long, narrow and lace shaped. The name comes from the millions of tiny, fragile seeds with fluffy tufts of white hair that carry them on the wind for miles. Cottonwood forests are an important and threatened habitat. Stands of these trees provide habitat for birds and shade, shelter and food for many animals. They need disturbed ground near water to get established, but dams and flood control have eliminated much of the terrain these trees need to grow.

However, most emigrants reached the Green River at the height of its annual flood when it flowed swift, wide, and deep.  Several enterprising pioneers settled along the river and established ferries to float emigrant wagons across. Ferry prices were usually high ranging from $3 to $16 per wagon and were virtually the only way to cross the river. Ferry prices sometimes changed daily to correspond with the changes in the river level. It often took several days to for large wagon trains to cross the river.  As the number of people headed west swelled into the tens of thousands each year, the number of ferries on the Green increased also. As many as 50 ferries are thought to have operated along the 50-mile corridor of the Green River Valley crossed by emigrant trails.

The other sites are Register Cliff and Independence Rock. After crossing a 40 miles stretch of waterless desert, wagon trains would stop and camp near the Green River Crossing, providing an opportunity for travelers to inscribe their names into the soft limestone.   Parting of the Ways  Names Hill is located along the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff, a shortcut that ran due west from the Little Sandy River and bypassed part of the main emigrant trail and Fort Bridger. The popularity of this route increased in the late 1840s, as people became more willing to risk crossing the desert to save about 46 miles of travel.   Stone Signatures  Historians believe the earliest writings at Names Hill were made by mountain men crossing the Green River on their way to trap beaver in the Rocky Mountains. These inscriptions date back to 1822, making them the oldest pioneer inscriptions in Wyoming. The names J.J. Shay – 1825 and Twig – 1832 are testimony of the early day explorers. Names Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.   Jim Bridger  One of the most famous inscriptions at Names Hill is that of mountain man Jim Bridger, whose mark was left here in 1844. His signature is a point of controversy for many historians, as he reportedly did not know how to read or write. Some believe that Bridger may have known enough to write his own name, while others believe that he had a traveling companion inscribe it for him.   Modern graffiti has damaged this site.

Before the turn of the century there were thousands of these majestic animals in Wyoming. Native Americans hunted the Bighorn for food and to use their horns to make powerful bows. By 1900 the Bighorn had been nearly wiped out. Unregulated hunting, disease, habitat destruction and competition with domestic sheep and cattle caused a drastic drop in the Bighorn population throughout the west. Strict hunting regulation and protection of the Bighorn’s habitat saved the remaining sheep and their population has slowly grown over the years.  When a ram reaches the age of seven his horns usually have reached full curl, where the tips of the horns are level with the base. Bighorns have ‘true horns” which means they grow continuously throughout the animal’s life and are not shed like the antlers of deer or elk. Both sexes of Bighorns have horns. Males have large heavy horns that curl. Females, or ewes, have short slender horns that curl only slightly.  Bighorns, like all wildlife, are easily disturbed by humans.

Gallagher & Blind Bill","LEGEND":"W.A. GALLAGHER AND BLIND BILL – MURDERED 1894 (Reburied December 17, 1978)  William Gallagher and his friend, Blind Bill, were killed on Meeteetse Creek below the old town of Arland in mid-March of 1894. Both men, about thirty, were born during the Civil War period.  Gallagher, who was somewhat of an outlaw, was tall, lean and wore a drooping dark mustache. He wore a gun most of the time, had a severe temper, and was a hard case in general.  Blind Bill was short, muscular, and wore a patch over his left eye, which was blind. Blind Bill was a good friend of Gallagher’s. Both men were working as cowboys in the Greybull River Country, and had probably found their way into the region on one of the early trail drives.  Gallagher was once described by A.A. Anderson, for whom he had once worked, as being one of the best horsemen and ropers he had ever known. However, his reputation was not as good as his figure. Gallagher told Anderson, one time after getting out of jail in Thermopolis, that: “I captured the town and was about to trade it off to the Indians when they threw me in jail.” On another occasion, Gallagher was accused of horse stealing and tried at the district court in Lander, Wyoming in 1891. Later in that year he was tried for forgery. He escaped being jailed each time, due to technicalities.  In 1893, Gallagher had become involved with 27 year old Belle Drewry, one of the single women that hung out around the town of Arland. Early in 1894 Belle began seeing Bill Wheaton. When Gallagher became aware of the friendship, he went into a jealous rage. On March 15h Gallagher took Belle over to the ranch house where Wheaton was. An argument developed and Gallagher pulled his six-shooter and held Wheaton and Belle at gunpoint for two hours, while he threatened them and kept cocking his six-shooter. Finally, Gallagher passed the incident off as kind of a joke and holstered his gun.  Belle informed Wheaton as to where a gun was hidden in the house. A little later she went out of the house and started walking toward Meeteetse.  When she didn’t return, Gallagher went out to see where she went. Wheaton then got the gun that was in the house. Gallagher was walking across the yard when Wheaton rested the gun against the ride of the door frame and shot him from behind. Wheaton then got on his horse and left.  When Blind Bill learned of Gallagher’s death, he was very upset and swore he would kill Wheaton in revenge for the death of his friend. Wheaton was soon informed that Blind Bill intended to kill him. Gallagher’s loyal friend never fulfilled his vow, for he was found a few days later, shot in the back by an unknown assassin. Although it was believed that Wheaton killed Blind Bill, it was never proven.  Both Gallagher and his friend, Blind Bill, were buried on a sage brush hill near Meeteetse Creek.  Wheaton was tried in the death of W.A. Gallagher and sentenced to eight years in the Wyoming State Penitentiary. He was released in 1898 after serving four years. Belle Drewry had been killed the year before in a gunfight at a saloon in Arland.

However, actual costs were 32 cents per day. The need for an adequate food supply and fresh vegetables were major factors in the internees starting a to grow many of their own crops.  More than 1,750 acres of federal land near the Heart Mountain Center was available for farming if the Shoshone Canal could be completed to bring in water from the Shoshone Dam hydroelectric project. The canal, which had been started by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), was completed by the internees in time for planting in the spring of 1943.  The Heart Mountain region averages 109 growing days per year, with crop harvest required before early frost in September. The farmers from the Yakima Valley in Washington were especially helpful in teaching methods they had developed for growing crops in a short growing season. Hot caps and hot beds were two methods used to grow plants. Crops raised in quantity were: wheat, barley, celery, corn, peas, radishes, daikon (a giant radish) nappa (a variety of cabbage) potatoes, gobo and melons. Root cellars, built by the internees, were used to store vegetables. Canning of some produce was done by contract with Big Horn Canning in Cowley, Wyoming. In addition to crops, over 1,000 hogs and 15,000 chickens were raised and over a million eggs were produced for consumption at Heart Mountain and other WRA camps since no outside sales were permitted.

The grizzly, wolf, whooping crane, and black-footed ferret are in these parts no longer. The land has also changed.  Cottonwood trees were once found in large stands along many western rivers. Today the cottonwood forest is vanishing. The annual spring snowmelt historically sent torrents of water down the rivers, laying new sediments on the floodplain. These exposed soils provided a seed bed for new vegetation. The cottonwood forest was established in this manner and young trees would grow up to replace the old, dying trees. Cottonwood forests, as seen on this stretch of the Bear, are becoming a rare habitat in America. Why? Because as rivers are dammed, flooding is diminished, and so too is the process for sustaining the cottonwood.  To help insure the cottonwood forest does not go the way of the grizzly and wolf in this country, man must understand the needs of the cottonwood. These riparian woodlands are vitally important in an otherwise treeless landscape. More species of wildlife inhabit these riparian woodlands than almost any other Wyoming habitat. The cottonwoods along this river exemplify the need for man to work with nature, and have consideration for nature, if we are to keep our wildlife and wildlands for future generations.

The most disputed fact is the location of the corral. In the early 1900’s area residents brought survivors of the fight, both Indian and white, to the area in hopes of pinpointing the exact location of the corral. Unfortunately, the survivors were not at the site at the same time and did not agree on the location. One site chosen is the location laid out near where you are standing. The other location is a brass marker several hundred yards to the southeast. There has been much study in an attempt to resolve this debate, including correspondence with early residents, aerial photography, and archaeological surveys. The strongest evidence comes from archaeology done over several years, which indicates that the laid out corral may be close to correct. But if the actual participants could not agree on a location, then the best and more accurate description of the location of the corral is to say that it was placed somewhere atop the plateau, between Big and Little Piney Creeks. As to the other controversies, Indian casualties can probably be estimated at between six and sixty and the time of the fight from 8:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

The abundance of deep open water as well as extensive shallow shorelines, ponds, wetlands and riparian areas provides feeding, shelter and nesting areas for many species. Outdoors enthusiasts come to Buffalo Bill, its tributaries and wetlands to hunt, birdwatch and enjoy the bounty of Wyoming’s wild birds.  Common Loon Loons frequent quiet lakes, usually sleeping on the water. They seldom come to land except to nest. They are large birds and must run at least 20 yards across the water to gain momentum to take off. Loons are excellent divers able to plunge to depths of 800 feet in search of small fish and aquatic insects. They are able to dive so deep because of the density of their near solid bones (most birds have hollow bones). They can stay underwater for up to sixty seconds. Loons require such pristine conditions for nesting that their presence is an indicator of clean water.  Common Mer?? These large birds are widespread across North America. They are highly social ducks gathering in large groups ???. They are very wary around people. Females have a rust colored head with a ragged crest, white chest and grey body. Males have a glossy green head without the crest and a white body. Both have a long, sharp red bill. Mergansers run across the water beating their wings to build up momentum to take off. They are expert divers who feed on fish and mollusks. They are a year round resident of Wyoming.  Northern Shoveler Named for its spoon like bill which has comb like structures along its edge, which allows this duck to strain small plants and animals from a wetland’s mucky bottom.  Western Grebe Commonly seen on Buffalo Bill’s water the Western Grebe has an elaborate mating dance where both male and female raise their torsos out of the water and caress each other with aquatic vegetation held in their long sharp bills. The courtship culminates in a rushing phase where both birds paddle vigorously across the water in an upright position. They nest in colonies with floating nests built of aquatic vegetation and feed on small fish and aquatic invertebrates.  Canada Goose These magnificent waterfowl are well known for their V-shaped migrating flocks and deep, resonant honking. They chiefly eat marsh vegetation and the stubble left over on farm fields. Typically they nest on islands and the shoreline in nests built of grass and lined with down from the females breast.  American White Pelican These gregarious birds usually travel in flocks and nest in colonies. They will work with each other to herd fish into shallow water where they are easier to catch. Pelicans have the largest wing span of any other Rocky Mountain Bird and are often seen wheeling in wide circles in the air. When fishing they will often skim low over the water with their bellies nearly touching the waves as they use air currents rising from the water surface to help them glide. Pelicans are very susceptible to pesticides which, along with the draining of wetlands, has caused a sharp drop in their numbers.  American Coot Often mistaken for a duck, the American Coot is a member of the ?? family. These birds have a distinct call that frequently is heard echoing across wetlands in the summer. When they swim their heads rock back and forth in synchrony with their swimming speed. Also called “Mud Hens,” Coots often squabble loudly with other waterbirds, charging across the water to intimidate rivals. They eat insects and vegetation floating on the surface and will dive deeply for small fish and amphibians.","LAT_1":44.5027,"LON_1":-109.24415,"LAT_2":44.5027,"LON_2":-109.2441,"Location":"44.5027, -109.2441","Location_X":-109.2441,"Location_Y":44.5027,"COUNTY":"Park","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49798711212_194f6f7eb6_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":643,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12171559.9114144,5540496.99360694]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":643,"FID":938,"MAMID":"PA0038A.11","SIGNNAME":"Shiras Moose Sign","LEGEND":"The moose is the largest member of the deer family. The Shiras Moose is the species found in the lower 48 states and southern British Columbia and Alberta.  The name “moose” is said to come from a northern Canadian Indian tribe who called the strange looking creature “mooswa” meaning “twig eater” or “the animal that strips bark off trees.” A large proportion of the moose’s diet is composed of woody plants, mostly twigs and branches of willows and streamside shrubs. In this region, other plants, including subalpine fir, are also an important part of their diet.  Extensive wetlands, considered prime moose habitat, are limited in the narrow valleys of the Absaroka Mountains. In this area, moose rely heavily on uplands for food and shade. Moose have never been abundant in this region. However, population counts have been higher than they are today. The landscape impacts caused by a reduction in coniferous forests from large scale and an increase in predators are presenting challenges to this species.  The conspicuous dewlap or “bell” hanging from the next of both the male and female moose is a secondary sexual characteristic that is more apparent on males. Along with the large palm-shaped antlers on bull moose, the bell may give cows a sense of the fitness of the bull as a mate.  Moose are usually peaceful animals, but can become aggressive when threatened or startled and can run up to 30 mph. Please respect them and give them plenty of space.  Moose may appear top heavy and awkward, but they are well adapted to environmental conditions faced year round. The legs are positioned so that when a step is taken each leg is raised straight up making it easier to move in deep water, mud, and snow or to step over logs.","LAT_1":44.483017,"LON_1":-109.338983,"LAT_2":44.483,"LON_2":-109.3389,"Location":"44.4830, -109.3389","Location_X":-109.3389,"Location_Y":44.483,"COUNTY":"Park","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464771222_37ab3c3eef_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":145,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11905726.585163,5124097.41475685]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":145,"FID":227,"MAMID":"CR0009.91","SIGNNAME":"Fort Fred Steele Information Sign","LEGEND":"Historical Overview-  The south central portion of Wyoming has long been a travel corridor for pre-historic and historic people. Native American tribes from the Great Basin region to the west crossed this area to hunt buffalo on the eastern plains.  From 1810 until the decline of the Rocky Mountain fur trade in the late 1830’s fur traders and trappers traversed this region on their way west in quest of beaver pelts, then retraced their route east laden with furs. These men left little evidence of their passing, but they explored the routes used by thousands of future settlers destined for locations west of Wyoming.  Although suggestions to  built a transcontinental railroad had been made in the 1840’s, no decision was reached until after the outbreak of the Civil War when Congress selected a central route through southern Wyoming. The Union Pacific Railroad, chartered by Congress, built track westward from Nebraska through Wyoming to Utah.  The military constructed a series of forts along the Union Pacific route to protect construction crews against attack by hostile Indians. Fort Fred Steele, named in honor of Civil War hero Major General Frederick Steele, was established in June, 1868 where the railroad crossed the North Platte River. Until 1886, when it was decommissioned, the garrison at Fort Fred Steele performed a variety of policing activities involving both Indians and civilians.  The railroad also promoted mercantile development, and livestock, lumber and mining industries. After the departure of the military, these industries continued and the town of Fort Steele survived. Completion of the transcontinental Lincoln Highway through Wyoming in 1922 contributed to a brief economic revival but rerouting of the highway in 1939 and the demise of the tie industry in 1940 ended the town’s function as a commercial center.

Riparian or riverside areas have high water tables allowing plants easy access to water. This leads to lusher green plant growth along these zones. Riparian zones have great ecological importance because they have a greater diversity of animal species than any other habitat. These zones provide food, water and cover for fish and wildlife. They also stabilize stream flow, remove sediments and help dissipate flood waters. Riparian areas are travel corridors for wildlife and provide nesting, feeding and watering areas for birds.  The majority of Wyoming’s wildlife are dependant on riparian areas and use them more than any other habitat. Healthy riparian areas keep water pure which benefits wildlife and people. However, these areas are very fragile and human abuse has damaged or destroyed many valuable wetland acres. Overgrazing, mining, dredging and flood control all cause this loss. The riparian zone in this canyon has been spared extensive human degradation and the result is a natural, clean and healthy river that supports abundant wildlife as well as providing pure water and many recreational opportunities.

Although only about 90,000 animals were left by 1922, today their population exceeds 500,000. Originally a plains animal, America’s westward migration forced the elk to seek the protection of more rugged terrain. Although well adapted to a mountain environment, elk still migrate each fall to lower elevations in search of winter browse.  A typical adult male may weigh between 600-800 pounds and proudly displays massive antlers, which are shed each spring as a new set begins to grow. Spring antlers grow exceptionally fast and are covered with a soft skin called velvet. By August the male elk’s “rack” is fully grown, the velvet drys and is shed. As the fall breeding season (called the “rut”) approaches, elk typically will “bunch” as the mystical sounds of the bugling bulls break the quiet, mountain air.

In the diverse habitats they can find the food, water and shelter they need. The canyon has a rich variety of plants wildlife need to survive – sagebrush, squaw currant, red-osier dogwood, arrowleaf balsamroot and willow are some important wildlife plants that grow here.  Chokecherry  A small tree or shrub, chokecherry grows along riparian zones. In the spring it has narrow clusters of small white flowers. It develop into clusters of dark purple berries that resemble miniature cherries. Birds, bears and deer all eat the berries. Moose and deer also eat the buds. Choke cherries were among the most important berries for American Indians who used them in stews and to make pemmican. The pit of the choke cherry contains poisonous hydrocyanic acid and must be removed before eating.  Sulphur Buckwheat  A perennial herb that grows in dry, rocky areas. It forms a dense mat of leaves close to the ground, the flowering stems grow up from this mat. In the summer the flowers are a creamy white, turning a rusty red in the fall. This small plant’s seeds are an important food source for small mammals such as chipmunks, mice and bighorn sheep and mule deer graze on it.  Gooseberry  A sprawling deciduous shrub that grows in riparian areas and on rocky slopes. A member of the current family, gooseberry has long, sharp spines on the stems. The flower is small and white and the berries are waxy and dark purple. Birds eat the berries.  Sumac  A large shrub that grows in sandy soils at the edges of forests. In the spring it has small white flowers. The berries, which stay on the plant all winter, are small, dark red clusters. They have one large seed and are covered with short, sticky hairs. Deer eat the twigs and berries and American Indians and pioneers used the berries to make a sour drink.  Oregon Grape  This evergreen shrub closely resembles holly. The spiny, durable leaves turn red after a hard frost. The plant grows on forested foothill slopes. In the spring it has clusters of bright yellow flowers and in the fall it develops clusters of small purplish blue berries. Blue grouse and black bears eat the berries.  Bitterbrush  the most important food source for deer in Sinks Canyon. Bitterbrush also called antelope brush grows on dry, open south-facing slopes. It prefers rocky, well-drained soils. It is a medium-sized, extensively branched shrub with many small green leaves. In the spring it has tiny bright yellow flowers. The small tree-lobed leaves are bitter, but are important food for big game animals, especially in the winter.

The big cats are elusive and seldom seen, generally doing everything possible to avoid contact with man.  The steep, wooded, and rocky terrain in Sinks Canyon and surrounding canyons is good Mountain Lion habitat. They usually den in a cave or crevice between rocks but will use an overhanging bank, the roots of a toppled tree or even a hollow tree.  Their main food source are deer, but they will hunt and eat porcupines, rabbits, moose, elk, mice and beaver. They are capable of great speed and giant bounds, but typically hut from ambush. They will sit motionless in a tree or on a ledge until prey approaches, then leap onto the shoulders of the prey biting deeply into the back of the neck while knocking the prey off balance. After a kill, the mountain lion will eat the softer organs, then the rest of the carcass is dragged to a hidden spot and covered with brush and dirt where it will be eaten later. They need the equivalent of one deer a week to survive and lion populations tend to correlate with deer populations. They are adaptable and can hunt in the day, but typically they are active only at night.  The large cats are widespread in rugged parts of the west, but aren’t abundant.  The Mountain Lion is a solitary hunter except when the mother is accompanied by her young. When the young are old enough they follow their mother and sometimes help with the hill – a process that teaches them how to hunt for themselves.  A female Mountain Lion gives birth to a litter of one to six kittens. The tan, black-spotted kittens are blind and helpless at birth, but their eyes open at two weeks. Their spots and mottled patterns help to camouflage them when the mother leaves to hunt for food.

Later the Reservation was also used for the Arapahos. As information that the springs have \"magnitude health giving properties\" became more generally known, Congress was requested to set aside the area for a national park or a reservation. In 1826, upon authority from Congress the Indian Commissioner sent--John M. McLaughlin to negotiate a treaty for the purchase of these springs. He secured an agreement whereby a part of the Reservation, approximately 10 miles square, was ceded to the United States government for the sum of $60,000. Among the signers of the treaty were the Shoshone Chief Washakie and the Arapahoe Chief Sharp Nose. Chief Washakie said that when game was bountiful he used to camp by the spring, but by 1890, hunting was so poor in this vicinity that it was seldom visited by the Indian.  Geology: Most of the water in these springs is thought to come underground from the Owl Creek Mountains. Rain falling in the mountains enters porous rock layers, moves slowly downward, and is here forced through crevices in the rocks. The heat and chemicals in the water are derived from the rock through which it passes and from gases that rise from deeply buried volcanic rocks. The terraces are made chiefly of lime and gypsum which separate from the cooling water. The colors are due primarily to primitive plants \"algae\" which grow in the warm water.

Though the Civil War raged on, the Nation continued its westward expansion through the efforts of men like Jim Bridger. A trapper, explorer, trader, hunter, scout and guide, Jim Bridger led miners north from the area we now call Fort Caspar. From there the trail led northwesterly through the southern Big Horn Mountains, across the Big Horn Basin, crossing the Shoshone River, into Montana through what was known as Pryor Gap, and finally rejoining the Bozeman Trail. The Bridger Trail reduced the threat of hostile actions against emigrants heading north and proved an important route in the settlement of the Northwest. The Bridger Trail crossed the Big Horn River approximately 12 miles southwest of here, near where the community of Heiber stands today.

However, many other species of wildlife benefit from this habitat area including mule deer, pronghorn antelope, moose, ruffed grouse, blue grouse, song birds and small mammals. Depending upon winter snow conditions, as many as 650 elk utilize the steep hillsides to escape heavy snow cover and find needed food. Along with most of the adjacent private, state and federal lands, this WHMA is considered a mountain shrub and grassland habitat. Those habitat types exhibit a variety of grasses and shrubs including sagebrush, bitterbrush and serviceberry. This diversity of plans is important to all wildlife and their survival. Elk, in particular, utilize the grasses during light snow cover, while the shrubs increase in important when the grasses are covered with deep snow and are not available as forage. It is important for all animals to have suitable wintering areas such as the Red Canyon WHMA.

Upon his arrival in the Green River Valley, he ordered immediate construction of a fort along the West bank of the River. Some uncertainty surrounds Bonneville's intent, but historians believe it was to use the fort as a trading establishment and military outpost to demonstrate to the British that Americans were in the West to stay. Dubbed \"Fort Nonsense\" and \"Bonneville’s Folly\" because of its poor location, the fort was soon abandoned as the severity of long Wyoming winters became apparent. However the fort commanded a strategic location in the heart of the rocky Mountain Trapping System. In 1833 it was the center of trading activity for the annual Rendezvous and for storage for the 1836 Rendezvous. The fort was fabricated of cotton wood pickets a foot or more in diameter and about fifteen feet in length. The perimeter was approximately eighty feet square, with blockhouses diagonally opposite each other. It had at least one internal structure which housed a forge that was used extensively during the fort's occupation. In 1989 an archeological survey was conducted at the site as one of Wyoming's Centennial celebration projects. The effort produced evidence of a well defined \"living surface\" and discovery of the external walls. The fort's forge area was investigated, showing active and extensive blacksmithing. Numerous early 1800s artifacts were unearthed, revealing much about Fort Bonneville's archeological significance as well as its historic contribution to events of the Fur Trade Era. These artifacts are on exhibit and interpreted at the Museum of the Mountain Man in Pinedale, Wyoming.

This river is about sixteen to eighteen rods wide (297 feet) and altogether too deep to be forded. Its banks are well lined with cottonwood but none large enough to make a canoe…”  Amidst bad weather and hordes of mosquitoes, the men worked three days chopping down trees, building two rafts, and floating the wagons across the Green. By Saturday, July 3rd the party was across the river. Three weeks later on July 24th, Brigham Young arrived in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake and the pioneers began a new life.  By 1869, when the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad ushered in a new era of transportation, about 68,000 Mormons had traveled the overland route to Utah.","LAT_1":41.88012,"LON_1":-109.80776,"LAT_2":41.8801,"LON_2":-109.8077,"Location":"41.8801, -109.8077","Location_X":-109.8077,"Location_Y":41.8801,"COUNTY":"Sweetwater","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49814530596_bb3a3944e4_h.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":518,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11926009.1522328,5235385.36132898]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":518,"FID":503,"MAMID":"NA0020C.92","SIGNNAME":"Independence Rock - Dr. Grace R.

The canyon is a natural pathway across the southern Wind River Mountains. For thousands of years wildlife and people have moved up from the Lander Valley, through the canyon, and over the high mountain passes to the other side of the range and back.  Archaeological digs have found that people were traveling through the canyon 9,000 years ago. Prehistoric people came to the canyon to hunt bighorn sheep, pick chokecherries and other plants and quarry valuable stone to make tools. Sinks Canyon was mainly used seasonally, probably in the fall when wildlife were migrating and berries were ripening.  Over the centuries many people have been a part of the history of Sinks Canyon. It isn’t possible to give a tribal affiliation to most of the prehistoric people that traveled the canyon, but some were probably the distant ancestors of the Shoshone people. When white fur trappers first came to this part of Wyoming in the early 19th century it was Crow territory. Popo Agie (pronounced Po- Po Zhuh) is a Crow word. No one is entirely sure of the meaning.  There are a small number of petroglyphs and pictographs scattered through the canyon. The oldest of these rock drawings is at least 6,000 years old.

Fred Lovejoy, a local miner, wrote about one of Sessions’ visits in his 1895 diary: “John Sessions came in this eve with his son, from Utah.”  At some point, Lovejoy took over Sessions’ claim and Uncle John’s tunnel.

Some birds use this habitat year-round as nesting or wintering grounds, many stop here on their yearly migrations.  Wetlands are one of the most rewarding places to experience Wyoming’s incredible diversity of wildlife. For waterfowl hunters and fisherman, wetlands are the most important place to practice their sport. Bird watchers can find no better place to see a magnificent diversity of wildlife, and all animals depend on the food, water and shelter found near wetlands habitat even if they don’t live there full time.  Sandhill Crane These large birds fly in V-shaped flocks like Canada Geese, but they make a distinct resonant rattling call when flying. The call can carry for over a mile and birders often hear the cranes long before they see them. They are very tall with grey bodies, long legs and necks and a distinct red forehead. They nest to westerm Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and Canada.  California Gull One of several gulls commonly seen in the Boysen area, these large white birds feed on insects, fish and forage for carrion. The state bird of Utah, the California Gull has a white head and yellow bill with a distinct red and black spot on the lower bill. They breed in large communities nesting on the open shorelines.  Willet A large grey sandpiper named for its distinct call: “will-will willet,” given loudly and often on the breeding grounds. The Willet is easily identified when it flies by a distinct black and white wing pattern. When one bird take flight all the others of the flock will join it crying loudly. It is thought that the bright flash of the Willet’s wing in flight serve as a danger warning to other shore birds. Willets will dive bomb intruders near their young.  Spotted Sandpiper This is the most widespread sandpiper in North America. It is distinguishable on the ground by the way it constantly teeters its body as it stands with tail up and head down. It has a stiff winged flight pattern swooping low over the water and shore. This bird is unusual in that the females defend nesting territories while the males tend to the nest and eggs.  Cliff Swallow These energetic little swallows swoop over water for insects. They nest in colonies on the cliff faces around Boysen in distinct gourd shaped nests made of mud. There can be hundreds of swallows and nests under rock overhangs.  American Avocet A graceful long-legged bird with a long upturned black bill and striking black, white and cinnamon coloring. Avocets feed by sweeping their bills from side to side along the surface of the water to pick up insects, crustaceans and seeds. They often feed in flocks, a line of birds advancing abreast, sometimes completely submerging their heads as the sweep the water for food.  Great Blue Heron This large is very adaptable, feeding on a variety of prey. It hunts patiently, standing motionlessly in shallow water waiting for fish, mice, small birds or insects to go by. These blue grey birds have a long, sharp yellow bill.

The town became known as the “Newcastle of the West,” (after the fabled England coal town). From 1868 to until the mid-nineteenth century, coal from Rock Springs area mines provided relatively clean burning fuel for steam locomotives that crossed the Rocky Mountains. In the late 1800’s English, Swedish, Finnish, Chinese, Italian, and Slovenian miners came to work in the mines. By the turn of the century the town boasted miners from around the world. Japanese, Welsh, Cornish, Scottish, German, and Polish workers joined other nationalities in the mines to make Rock Springs one of the most diverse communities in Wyoming. When in the 1950s the underground coal mines closed many thought that Rock Springs would vanish. The newly opened Trona mines west of present Green River employed many of the miners that chose to stay in Rock Springs.

Water from the tributary flows through, unseen beneath the peat-like vegetation. The water freezes solid in the winter and remains frozen during the spring and early summer because of the insulating peat. Early explorers, and emigrants traveling to Oregon and California, stopped here often, welcoming the ice after having spent many days traversing the hot prairie. One forty-niner, Henry Tappan, wrote in his journal that it was a good place to enjoy a julep. Travelers who arrived late in the summer were disappointed to discover that the ice had finally melted. Today the Ice Slough is nearly dry and very little ice forms in the winter because much of the water has been drained off for irrigation.","LAT_1":42.51755028,"LON_1":-108.0087087,"LAT_2":42.5175,"LON_2":-108.0087,"Location":"42.5175, -108.0087","Location_X":-108.0087,"Location_Y":42.5175,"COUNTY":"Fremont","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464766117_a34bcf7d00_z.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":601,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12156671.7087572,5545524.51373408]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":601,"FID":976,"MAMID":"PA0019I.11","SIGNNAME":"W.A. Gallagher and Blind Bill – Murdered 1894","LEGEND":"(Reburied December 17, 1978)  William Gallagher and his friend, Blind Bill, were killed on Meeteetse Creek below the old town of Arland in mid-March of 1894. Both men, about thirty, were born during the Civil War period.  Gallagher, who was somewhat of an outlaw, was tall, lean and wore a drooping dark mustache. He wore a gun most of the time, had a severe temper, and was a hard case in general.  Blind Bill was short, muscular, and wore a patch over his left eye, which was blind. Blind Bill was a good friend of Gallagher’s. Both men were working as cowboys in the Greybull River Country, and had probably found their way into the region on one of the early trail drives.  Gallagher was once described by A.A. Anderson, for whom he had once worked, as being one of the best horsemen and ropers he had ever known. However, his reputation was not as good as his figure. Gallagher told Anderson, one time after getting out of jail in Thermopolis, that: “I captured the town and was about to trade it off to the Indians when they threw me in jail.” On another occasion, Gallagher was accused of horse stealing and tried at the district court in Lander, Wyoming in 1891. Later in that year he was tried for forgery. He escaped being jailed each time, due to technicalities.  In 1893, Gallagher had become involved with 27 year old Belle Drewry, one of the single women that hung out around the town of Arland. Early in 1894 Belle began seeing Bill Wheaton. When Gallagher became aware of the friendship, he went into a jealous rage. On March 15h Gallagher took Belle over to the ranch house where Wheaton was. An argument developed and Gallagher pulled his six-shooter and held Wheaton and Belle at gunpoint for two hours, while he threatened them and kept cocking his six-shooter. Finally, Gallagher passed the incident off as kind of a joke and holstered his gun.  Belle informed Wheaton as to where a gun was hidden in the house. A little later she went out of the house and started walking toward Meeteetse.  When she didn’t return, Gallagher went out to see where she went. Wheaton then got the gun that was in the house. Gallagher was walking across the yard when Wheaton rested the gun against the ride of the door frame and shot him from behind. Wheaton then got on his horse and left.  When Blind Bill learned of Gallagher’s death, he was very upset and swore he would kill Wheaton in revenge for the death of his friend. Wheaton was soon informed that Blind Bill intended to kill him. Gallagher’s loyal friend never fulfilled his vow, for he was found a few days later, shot in the back by an unknown assassin. Although it was believed that Wheaton killed Blind Bill, it was never proven.  Both Gallagher and his friend, Blind Bill, were buried on a sage brush hill near Meeteetse Creek.  Wheaton was tried in the death of W.A. Gallagher and sentenced to eight years in the Wyoming State Penitentiary. He was released in 1898 after serving four years. Belle Drewry had been killed the year before in a gunfight at a saloon in Arland.

The population of the settlement swelled to nearly 2,000 as construction of the Echo Tunnel in Utah and the onset of winter held up track laying. This railroad boomtown, its name changed to Bear River City, developed a reputation for unparalleled rowdiness. The town consisted of a few stores and boarding houses standing alongside numerous saloons and gambling parlors. These liquor and gaming establishments catered to a nefarious crowd, causing the Frontier Index to report Bear River City was \"the liveliest city, if not the wickedest in America.\" The Frontier Index, a traveling newspaper printed at various points along the Union Pacific route, outraged the Bear River City's lawless element by endorsing vigilante activity as a means of eliminating undesirables. Whipped to a frenzy, on November 20, 1868 an unruly mob burned down the Index office. The town's law-abiding citizens retaliated against the mob and the ensuing battle lasted well into the night. Order had been restored by the time troops arrived from Fort Bridger the next morning. The railroad, not riotous mobs, caused the town's demise when the Union Pacific refused to construct a siding connecting Bear River City to the mainline. The populace hurriedly packed their belongings and moved on to Evanston, a town which offered better prospects.

Habitat quality and availability are the keys to mule deer survival. Compared to elk and white-tailed deer, mule deer have different food and habitat preferences. Populations respond poorly to habitat loss, fragmentation, degradation and human disturbance. Quality winter range and unimpeded migration corridors are especialy important.  Mule deer have large ears that move independently and almost constantly – just like a mule’s. The ears act like a satelite dish to collect the smallest of noises. They have a large, whitish rump patch with a short black-tipped tail.  One of the “mulie’s” best known characteristics is its bouncing gait known as “stotting.” When they stot, the deer bounds and lands with all four legs at the same time. So, it looks like it’s using a pogo stick. This stiff-legged gait allows the deet to out-distance predators in rough terrain and see above thick brush.  Fawns are born in late spring. Mature females often have twins, while yearlings may have only a single fawn.  The gangly babies weigh around seven pounds at birth. Fawns give off very little scent and remain motionless when bedded. These traits and a camouflage coat help foil predators.  If you come across a bedded fawn that appears to be abandoned, please do not tough it. The mother is nearby feeding.  Males have heavy antlers that are equally branched with forked tines, or points. This is in contrast to the unbranched points of the white-tailed deer.

Horns are composed of a sheath of fused hairs covering a bone core. This is in contrast to antlers which are made of bone. A male’s horn may grow 15 inches or more while a female’s are no longer than the ears.  Historically, pronghorns equaled the bison in numbers with herds reported to extend for 70 miles.

He named his new company the Overland Stage Line and soon abandoned the central trail.\nHolladay determined that a route further south was better because it would be safer, shorter and closer to Denver where economic growth was taking place due to the 1859 gold rush. The new route, established by trappers and explorers, became known as the Overland Trail.\nThe Overland split off from the older Oregon Trail near North Platte, Nebraska. From that point coaches paralleled the South Platte rolling west through Colorado before turning north to begin a steep and rocky climb into southern Wyoming where the trail flanked the Medicine Bow Range before turning westward again. After crossing plains, rivers and streams and winding through mountain passes, the trail entered the Green River Basin. Traffic passed through this valley, following Bitter Creek to its confluence with the Green River. It then branched north to join the Oregon Trail near the junction of the Blacks Fork and Hams Fork Rivers.

In early August 1942, the Heart Mountain project director hired Clifford D. Carter as superintendent and John Corbett as high school principal. Their immediate task was to find teachers. Twenty-six Caucasian teachers and four internees, the latter having been issued Wyoming teaching certificates stamped, “Valid at Heart Mountain only,” were hired. Turnover was high, with Clarissa Corbett the only teacher to remain through the life of the Center.  Classes were conducted in barracks with 6 rooms in each building. Each room contained a coal stove, a single light fixture hanging from the rafters, low wall partitions with open rafters and benches for seating. Initially there were no desks for students, no blackboards and few school supplies. Often 50 textbooks had to suffice for two hundred students. Students located near the stove sat perspiring, while those near the door and windows wore their coats to keep warm. In December 1942, Celotex insulation wallboard for partitioning arrived, but it was evident from the beginning that high school classes could not be successfully conducted in the barracks.  The high school building was completed for the 1943-1944 school term, constructed for the most part by the internees themselves, under the supervision of Bennett & Lewis Contractors of Billings, Montana. Tatsu Hori, an engineer at the Stanford Research Institute prior to his incarceration, designed the school’s heating system. The high school has 39 classrooms, a gymnasium/auditorium, and other office space. It was not until the second year, that the center obtained enough textbooks and school supplies.  Heart Mountain High School had the normal curriculum of other Wyoming schools at the time. The journalism class published a mimeographed school paper, The Heart Mountain Eagle, and school annuals called the Heart Mountain Tempo were edited in the camp and send out to be printed in 1944 and 1945.  Eventually, five elementary schools were consolidated into two schools, Lincoln and Washington. They were more centrally located within the camp but still in barracks.  Teachers developed curriculums believed to be most beneficial for students who had been stripped of their freedom, which also met the approval of the Wyoming State Board of Education. Not the least of problems was how to teach the tenets of democracy at the same time the students were looking out the window at guard towers and barbed wire fences. Heart Mountain High School graduated 808 students in its three-year existence. The Class of 1943 had 249 graduates, the Class of 1944 had 302 graduates and the Class of 1945 had 250 graduates.

For them that conundrum had been a far more perplexing problem than such an ordinary task as negotiating the crossing, however torturous, of an unexplored pass occurring along the uncomplicated divide of an unconnected mountain chain. Hereabouts the Continental Divide is a tricky, triple phenomenon wherein the unguided seeker of a crossing might find the right approach and still arrive at the wrong ending. In North America there are seven river systems that can be cited as truly continental in scope but only in this vicinity and at one other place do as many as three of them head against a common divide. Indians called this region the Land of Many Rivers and mountain men named the pass Union, thereby both--once again--proving themselves gifted practitioners of nomenclature. Union Pass is surrounded by an extensive, rolling, mountain-top terrain wherein elevations vary between nine and ten thousand feet and interspersed water courses deceptively twist and turn as if undetermined betwixt an Atlantic or a Pacific destination. This mountain expanse might be visualized as a rounded hub in the center of which, like an axle's spindle, fits the pass. Out from this hub radiate three spokes, each one climbing and broadening into mighty mountain ranges--southeasterly the Wind Rivers, southwesterly the Gros Ventres and northerly, extending far into Montana, the Absarokas. THE RENDEZVOUS (Plaque #2) - Twelve thousand foot mountain plateaus dominating this view of Green River and Snake River headwaters seemingly provide a southwesterly buttress for loftier peaks forming the core of the Wind River Range. Beyond them it is 43 miles from Union Pass to where confluence of the Green and its Horse Creek tributary marks the most famed of several \"rendezvous\" grounds relating to that epoch in American history known as the Rocky Mountain Fur Trade. \"Rendezvous\", defined as a trade fair in wilderness surroundings, was held in diverse locations throughout the Central Rocky Mountain region. It required spacious, grassy environs for grazing thousands of horses, raising hundreds of trapper and Indian lodges and for horse races and other spectacles exuberantly staged by mountain men and Indians then relaxed from vigilance against dangers which otherwise permitted no unguarded carrousels. A favorite area for \"rendezvous\" was along the Green, recognized for producing the primmest beaver peltry and for conveniently straddling the South Pass logistic route utilized for transport of trade goods and furs between St. Louis and the mountains. On the Green the finest \"rendezvous\" grounds--rendered especially famous through Alfred Jacob Miller's paintings of the 1837 scene--were those at Horse Creek. Depending on arrival of St. Louis supply caravans, \"rendezvous\" usually extended through early July. At the close of revels--leaving many mountain men deeply in debt--there remained up to two months before prime furs signaled the start of fall hunting. The intervening time was pleasantly occupied in traveling and exploring high mountain terrain; then trails around Union Pass were furrowed by Indian travois only to be leveled again by the beating hoofs of the trapper's pack trains. \u000b\u000bTHREE WATERS MOUNTAIN (Plaque #3) \u000bSoutheast rises a mountain given a name, one such as Indians or mountain men discovering a geographical phenomenon might have chosen. Midway of its four-mile-long crest is the key point, one of only two in North America, where as many as three of the continent's seven major watersheds interlock. Here a raindrop splits into thirds, the three tiny driblets destined to wend their separate ways along continuously diverging channels to the oceans of the world. One driblet arrives in the Gulf of Mexico, 3,000 miles distant by way of Jakeys Fork, Wind River, Bighorn, Yellowstone, Missouri and Mississippi; another joins currents running 1,4000 miles to the Pacific through Fish Creek, the Gross Ventre, Snake and Columbia; the final one descends more than 1,300 miles to the Gulf of California via Roaring Fork, Green River and the Colorado.

Crazy Horse and Hump lead a small number of warriors across the hills to the west in a decoy attack on the Little Piney Camp (1).

The 345 mile Central Division of the Pacific Wagon road went from South Pass, Wyoming, to City of Rocks, Idaho, a geologic formation, which marked the Division's western boundary. Superintendent Frrederick W. Lander of Salem, Massachusetts, supervised construction for the U.S. Department of the Interior. The 256 mile section of the road leading from South Pass to Fort Hall, Idaho, is known as the Lander Cut-off. The Cut-off traversed this Salt Bear River Valley for 21 miles and parallels Highway 89 through this area. The new route afforded water, wood, and forage for emigrants and their stock. Between 1858 and 1912, it provided travelers with a new, shorter route to Oregon and California, saving wagon trains seven days. Lander, with a crew of 15 engineers, surveyed the route in the summer of 1857. The following summer, 115 men, many recruited from Salt Lake City's Mormon emigrants, constructed the road in less than 90 days at a cost of $67,873. The invention of the automobile led to its abandonment.   STOCK TRAIL  Travel along the Oregon Trail was not restricted to one direction.

These men left little evidence of their passing, but they explored the routes used by thousands of future settlers destined for locations west of Wyoming.  Although suggestions to  built a transcontinental railroad had been made in the 1840’s, no decision was reached until after the outbreak of the Civil War when Congress selected a central route through southern Wyoming. The Union Pacific Railroad, chartered by Congress, built track westward from Nebraska through Wyoming to Utah.  The military constructed a series of forts along the Union Pacific route to protect construction crews against attack by hostile Indians. Fort Fred Steele, named in honor of Civil War hero Major General Frederick Steele, was established in June, 1868 where the railroad crossed the North Platte River. Until 1886, when it was decommissioned, the garrison at Fort Fred Steele performed a variety of policing activities involving both Indians and civilians.  The railroad also promoted mercantile development, and livestock, lumber and mining industries. After the departure of the military, these industries continued and the town of Fort Steele survived. Completion of the transcontinental Lincoln Highway through Wyoming in 1922 contributed to a brief economic revival but rerouting of the highway in 1939 and the demise of the tie industry in 1940 ended the town’s function as a commercial center.

As they flow down canyons, glaciers act as giant bulldozers pushing rock and earth before them. At least three glacial episodes widened and deepened this canyon as gravity pulled them down the course of the Popo Agie River. As you look up and down the canyon you can see it is a “U” shape – a sign it was created by glacial activity. Without the glaciers exposing the soft sedimentary rock in the lower part of the canyon the Sinks may never have formed, and the ecology of the canyon would be very different.  The effects of glacial erosion are spectacular in the mountains. The jagged, sharp peaks and cliffs in the Wind River Range show how much rock was quarried by the ice. At the head of glaciated valleys in the mountains you often find deep, steep-walled bowls called cirques. Enough ice can lift and carry rocks that weigh tons. Glaciers moving out of the mountains tore off huge pieces of granite and carried them for miles. When the glaciers melted, these rocks were often deposited in unusual places and positions. Perched boulders are rocks sitting on surfaces with no visible way of having gotten there.  Glacial erratic are boulders carried from higher in the mountains and deposited on a surface of different material than the erratic.  Glacial Morains are visible in Sinks Canyon. These are long piles of rock deposited as the glaciers melted. A glacier acts like a giant conveyer belt. Material scrapped from the floor and walls of the canyon by ice is constantly carried to the glaciers sides and end. When the glacier melts this material is dropped into piles called moraine. A moraine is made up of many kinds and sizes of rock, gravel and sand picked up higher in the mountains and brought into the canyon by the ice. This picture show two prominent moraines up the canyon, a large “end moraine” is visible near the Visitor Center.  How do glaciers move? Glaciers form when more snow falls during the winter than melts off in the summer. When the snow pack gets deep enough, the weight crystallizes the lower levels into glacial ice; dense flexible material that can flow. When the glacier reaches a depth of about 150’, it puts enormous pressure on the ice at its base causing it to crystallize and move outward. Gravity causes glaciers to flow. Valley glaciers, like the kind that shaped Sinks Canyon, are pulled downhill following an already existing channel. Glacial movement is slow, from a few inches to a few yards a day. It may be imperceptible to the eye, but the glacier is moving steadily, dramatically altering the land as it goes.","LAT_1":42.73954,"LON_1":-108.82343,"LAT_2":42.7395,"LON_2":-108.8234,"Location":"42.7395, -108.8234","Location_X":-108.8234,"Location_Y":42.7395,"COUNTY":"Fremont","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49939250241_87a9f79465_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":569,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12127023.0982183,5569651.65489675]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":569,"FID":1051,"MAMID":"PA0011.92","SIGNNAME":"Heart Mtn Relocation Center Monument","LEGEND":"Bronze plaque with U.S. eagle at top and U.S. seal at bottom left corner.

Mine explosions, inhalation of toxic gases, and crushing by mine collapse and coal car caused these fatal accidents.  Two miners died in an explosion in one of the worse accidents in this region in the Dietz Mine NO. 8 on June 4, 1919. Compounding the tragedy, one of the miners, Bob Gault, had traded his usual shift with another miner in order to attend his daughter’s wedding the next day.  TO THE BOYS OF THE RESCUE CREW From the Wyoming State Mine Inspector’s 1921 Report. When the damp explodes in a distant room, Or the roof of an entry falls, Sealing the men in a living tomb With the thick and soundless walls, When the women crowd at the open slope And wail as the women do, It’s then we call for the nerve and craft Of the Boys of the Rescue Crew. They take the smoke, As a sort of joke; They dare the fire damp too; For it’s all their trade, And they’re not afraid, The Boys of the Rescue Crew.  WYOMING’S 1886 COAL MINE SAFETY ACT This Act made Wyoming Territory a leader in improving mining conditions. As well as implementing safety codes, the law prohibited boys under 14 and all females from being in or around the mines. Coal mine safety continues to be a headline issue today.","LAT_1":44.901697,"LON_1":-107.031439,"LAT_2":44.9016,"LON_2":-107.0314,"Location":"44.9016, -107.0314","Location_X":-107.0314,"Location_Y":44.9016,"COUNTY":"Sheridan","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49814219382_9992043b15_h.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":907,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12288590.8824537,5059143.61662666]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":907,"FID":156,"MAMID":"UT0001I.02","SIGNNAME":"The Carter Cemetery","LEGEND":"The Carter Cemetary\nThe decedents re-interred here in 1933 represent a very significant cross section of those individuals whose names and contributions will ever be associated with Fort Bridger’s early day history.

From these lofty beginnings, it then drops 6,200 feet in elevation down through the Medicine Lodge Canyon to its mouth where it begins an exuberant meander through lush meadows to its juncture with Paint Rock Creek.  With an average summertime temperature of 44 degrees Fahrenheit, the clear, swift water provides ideal habitat for the mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly larvae that trout  love to eat, and that are found crawling on, or stuck to, the underside of the rocks in the creek bed. Sampling studies done by the Wyoming Department of Environment Quality show that more than 60% of the insects in the creek are from the Mayfly Family. Having a low tolerance for pollution, large Mayfly and Stonefly populations are an effective indicator of a healthy environment and good to excellent water quality.  More than just a food pantry, the creek’s gravel bottom, oxygenated and washed by the rippling flow of the water also provides areas necessary for trout to spawn. Starting in November Brown trout will scour off portions of the creek bottom to form spawning beds called “redds.” A quiet, careful, observer may see the trout lying in these clean, white gravel beds as they lay and fertilize their eggs. After about two months, the eggs hatch and the young trout, or “alevin,” emerge to begin a new life cycle and hopefully survive to provide future fishing opportunities for anglers of all ages.

Mining plays a fundamental role in the history of the South Pass region. Gold may have been discovered as early as 1842, but gold fever did not strike until 1867 when a sample of South Pass ore arrived in Salt Lake City. News of the discovery spread swiftly and hordes of expectant millionaires descended on the new towns of South Pass City, Atlantic City, and Miner’s Delight. The boom played out quickly. The easily obtained placer gold was rapidly exhausted and miners began leaving the area in the early 1870s. Despite the brief duration of the boom, mining activity did not cease. In 1884, an enterprising Frenchman named Emile Grainer began organizing the construction of a hydraulic gold mining system which employed many local residents over a ten year period. The Fisher Dredge Company recovered considerable gold ore from the bed of Rock Creek during the 1930s. More recently, the United States Steel iron ore mine operated near Atlantic City from the early 1960s until 1983. Hard rock miners also reopen periodically and some are presently operating.

Explorers and mountain men trapped beaver in the Seedskadee area; and the hundreds of thousands of pioneers who crossed the Green River hunted game here.  Construction of the Fontenelle Dam about 20 miles upstream changed the natural flooding cycle of the Green River, affecting the fish and wildlife habitat along the river. The dam created prime trout habitat; yet it endangered the natural marshlands bordering the river that relied on spring flooding. These marshlands are critical nesting habitat for many species of waterfowl.  Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge was established by Congress in 1965 to help offset the loss of marshlands habitat resulting from construction of both the Fontenelle Dam and the Flaming Gorge Dam which is about 100 miles downstream in Utah.

For centuries, charcoal was favored as a fuel source because it burns hotter, cleaner, and more slowly than wood.  USES  Much of the charcoal made at Piedmont was sent by railroad to mining ore smelters in Utah’s Salt Lake Valley. Charcoal, which burns at more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, is used in smelting – a process of extracting metal, such as lead or copper, from its ore. Charcoal was also shipped to Fort Bridger as fuel for the blacksmith forges.  PROCESS  Workers filled the kilns with about 30 cords of pine logs, harvested in the nearby mountains. The logs were packed tight and double-stacked, end-to-end. The wood was lit, but not allowed to fully burn, just smolder. Charcoal makers controlled the heat by plugging small air vent holes around the base of the kiln. It took six to eight days of slow firing to reduce the wood to charcoal. Cooling took another five days. On average, 100 parts of wood yielded about 25 parts of charcoal, by weight.","LAT_1":41.21983,"LON_1":-110.61984,"LAT_2":41.2198,"LON_2":-110.6198,"Location":"41.2198, -110.6198","Location_X":-110.6198,"Location_Y":41.2198,"COUNTY":"Uinta","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49464058123_a714e88fa1_c.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":249,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12111438.1468683,5275204.67204058]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":249,"FID":635,"MAMID":"FR0076.11","SIGNNAME":"Sinks Canyon Corridor to the Winds","LEGEND":"From the time the glaciers of the last Ice Age retreated about 16,000 years ago, people have journeyed into Sinks Canyon.

Wherever they have settled they made building of schools a first priority. The Mormons had hardly finished putting up their own log cabins when they started planning for their schools. They built a large stone grade school dedicated in 1909, then began construction of a high school building. It was to be church-supported and called THE BIG HORN ACADEMY. The first classes of this academy-to-be met in the grade school building while construction proceeded. Though the Mormon Church supplied the actual money required to build and equip the facility, by far the major portion of the project was accomplished with donated labor, expertise, and machines which were quite primitive by modern standards. The building was completed in 1916. Its program was essentially that of a high school although in the context of that time, it was thought of, almost, as a college. Students came to the Academy from a wide area to live and board, somewhat as students leave home today for high education. The Academy was operated as a church school until 1924 when its facilities and responsibilities were transferred to the Cowley School District thereafter known as the Cowley High School. During its life as the Big Horn Academy 178 students graduated from the school.THE LOG COMMUNITY BUILDING\nDuring the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt began the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to help stimulate economic activity. In 1933, the Cowley town leaders sought help from the WPA to build a community hall. It was built from lodge pole logs, cut and hauled from the Pryor Mountains north of Cowley. The WPA furnished a grant to pay laborers wages of thirty cents per hour. No records remain to tell exactly how much was spent or how many local citizens donated time, horses, wagons, tools, or equipment, but it is estimated that nearly a hundred people worked on the project without compensation. The actual money spent was perhaps around $10,000. A group of workers from five to a dozen stayed with the operation from beginning to end. Adolf Anderson, a man of very little formal education, became both the designer and superintendent. He obviously knew what he was doing. Although the exterior is quite conventional, the interior has almost a cathedral effect with its soaring, open trusswork built of 14 inch logs. Through the years the building has been used for public meetings, church conferences, annual celebrations, family gatherings, class reunions, dances, political rallies, musicals, dramas, school athletics, and even prize fights.

There, instead of following the regular Oregon Trail route southwest to Fort Bridger, then northwest to reach Bear river below present day Cokeville, Wyoming, this wagon train pioneered a new route. Either Hitchcock or Greenwood, it is uncertain which, made the decision to lead the wagons due west, in effect along one side of a triangle.  The route was hazardous, entailing crossing some 50 miles of semi-arid desert in the heat of summer and surmounting mountain ridges, but it saved approximately 85 miles from the Fort Bridger route and 5 or 6 days travel. The route was first known as the Greenwood Cut-off.  It was the Gold Rush year of 1849 that brought this “Parting of the Ways” into prominence. Of the estimated 30,000 Forty-niners probably 20,000 travelled the Greenwood Cut-off which, due to an error in the 1849 Joseph E. Ware guide book, became known as the Sublette Cut-off.  In the ensuing years further refinements of the Trail route were made. In 1852 the Kinney and Slate Creek Cut-offs diverted trains from portions of the Sublette Cut-off, but until the covered wagon period ended, the Sublette Cut-off remained a popular direct route, and this “Parting of the Ways” was the place for crucial decisions.

The Shiras moose is the species found in this part of the Rocky Mountains. In Sinks Canyon moose are most frequently seen along the river in the winter. As the snow gets deep higher in the mountains, moose follow the river down into the canyon where it is easier to get food. They browse on willows and other shrubs that grow in the riparian zone. In the summer moose often are seen in deep water feeding on aquatic vegetation. They are not afraid to feed in water over their head. Moose have several adaptations that make it easier for them to spend time in the water. To keep from sinking into the mud of wet areas, their dewclaws are very large and spread out helping support their weight. Their hind legs are also positioned so that when a step is taken, each leg is actually raised straight up making it easier to step out of wet med. When seen on open ground this gives them an awkward looking walk, but is helpful walking in wet areas. A healthy bull moose can be seven feet tall at the shoulder and weight 1200 pounds. Their color varied from black to shades of brown with white “stockings” on their feet. The young are borin in the spring after an eight month gestation.  The conspicuous “bell” hanging from the throat of both male and female moose is a secondary sexual characteristic. A notable feature of bull moose are the huge palmate antlers. They begin growing in April and by August the velvet is shed and the rut begins.

Soon, mounted warriors circled around the corral. Using their horses as shields, they quickly rode in close to fire arrows or guns, and then zigzagged away from the soldiers’ rifles. During the first attack from the south, Hairy Hand, a Miniconjou, rode straight at the corral to county coup. Hit by a soldier’s bullet, he laid out in the open until a young warrior named White Bull ran in and dragged him to safety. Struck in the leg, the Sans Arc warrior Crazy Horse fell from his horse, and was carried off by his comrades. The mounted charge failed, and the war leaders Crazy Horse of the Ogalalas and Hump of the Miniconjous organized the warriors for an assult on foot.  As the foot charge moved toward the corral, the Ogalala Only Man rushed ahead, almost reaching the wagon boxes before the bullets killed him. The attack stalled, and some warriors concealed themselves in the bush and started firing into the corral with guns captured during the battle of One Hundred in the Hands. These snipers most of the casualties suffered by the soldiers.  During a lull before the next attack, one of the bravest acts of the day took place. Jipala, a tall, impressive Miniconjou, walked toward the corral, carrying a shield, lance and bow. Singing his death song, he ran forward, jumping in the air and firing arrows at the corral. Finally, the soldiers bullets found him, and he laid dead before the corral. Both warriors and soldiers talked of his bravery for many years to come.  Two more Miniconjous, Muskrat Stands on His Lodge and Packs His Leg, died in foot charges. During the final attack, the Lakota Young Duck was shot dead leading his assault, and three of his people wounded attempting to recover his body.  Once more, the warriors attempted a mounted charge, but the soldiers’ guns kept up a fierce fire. The assault ended before reaching the corral, but not before Sun’s Road of the Cheyennes was killed. His death was the last of the day.  The boom of Smith’s howitzer signaled the end of fighting.

Residents relied on local natural resources like timber, stone, and clay to construct their new community. In 1899, two local builders, James Steward and C.E. Carpenter, built and operated a crude kiln to make bricks. They dug clay from pits near this location and formed the soft earth into blocks, which were “fired” or baked in the kiln. *Help Preserve and Protect our Heritage. We encourage you to view the site responsibly and maintain it for future visitors to enjoy.*  BRICKMAKING The basic brickmaking process involves digging up the clay, letting it air dry, and then crushing it into a powder. Water is added to the dried clay to make it pliable. The moist clay is then shaped into individual bricks using wooden molds, and then dried in the sun. To complete the process, the “green” bricks are stacked in a kiln and “fired” for several days. Firing the clay hardens it and makes it water repellent.  Due to the limited source of clay and the complexity of brickmaking, the use of bricks was spare. However, no other material could quite replace it in the construction of chimneys, hearths, and forges.  Over-fired bricks become vitrified (glassy) as the intense heat deforms and fuses them together into one large mass, like the one found at this location. Stewart and Carpenter were not experienced brickmakers and probably ruined more than one batch due to their limited skill in the art.","LAT_1":42.47181,"LON_1":-108.81308,"LAT_2":42.4718,"LON_2":-108.813,"Location":"42.4718, -108.8130","Location_X":-108.813,"Location_Y":42.4718,"COUNTY":"Fremont","PICTURE_LINK":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49968399422_140dc223df_b.jpg"}},{"type":"Feature","id":194,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12112624.41189,5235120.07842247]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":194,"FID":495,"MAMID":"FR0032.94","SIGNNAME":"South Pass City Information Sign","LEGEND":"SOUTH PASS CITY, WYOMING A region rich in history. A city rich with gold. From 1812 to 1868 this open country at the end of the Wind River mountains provided a passage--the only passage--through the Rocky Mountain barrier of the Continental Divide for some 500,000 westerning Americans. Through this Great South Pass came the Mountain Men, fur trappers and traders, explorers, missionaries, covered wagon pioneers on the Oregon, California and Mormon trails, overland stage coaches, military expeditions, and Pony Express riders. By 1866, however, traffic on the great trails had dwindled with the anticipated completion of the transcontinental railroad. Then, in 1867, gold was discovered on Willow Creek. The rush was on. By 1869 more than 30 mines were in operation and some 3,000 people populated the region. The instant towns of South Pass City, Atlantic City and Miners Delight were rip-roaring and wide open for business. This lusty, male-dominated mining district became the unlikely center of a move for female suffrage when it elected William H. Bright, a South Pass City miner and saloon keeper, to the first Wyoming Territorial council in Cheyenne. Bright introduced a Female Suffrage Act that gave all adult Wyoming women the right to vote and hold public office. The act was passed by the legislative body and signed into law on December 10, 1869, making Wyoming the first official government in the world to grant equal rights to women. The mining boom went bust in the 1870s and the population moved on to the next bonanza. The towns became near ghosts, although some limited mining activity continues.

Emigrants traveling west needed safe routes where food and water were available. Guides familiar with the region determined the best route was across the basins of Wyoming, passing north of the southern Rocky Mountains. Over the next century, stagecoach routes, railroads, telegraph and telephone lines, and roadways would be established along this corridor. (Starting in the upper right and moving clockwise)  EMIGRANT TRAILS 1843-1869 – Emigrant trails included the Oregon, California, and Mormon Trails to the north and the Cherokee and Overland Trails, which followed a more southern path. More than 500,000 emigrants traveled these westward routes across Wyoming to new lives in California, the Salt Lake Valley, and the Pacific Northwest.  PONY EXPRESS 1860-1861 – Pony Express horseback riders carried mail in relay between St. Joseph, Missouri and Sacramento, California in only 10 days. Stations, where riders would change horses, were spaced about 10 miles apart along the 2,000 mile trail.  TRANSCONTINENTAL TELEGRAPH 1860s – The Pacific Telegraph Company ran its cross-country telegraph line through southern Wyoming in the early 1860s. At the time, the telegraph served as the only instantaneous communication link between the east and west coasts.  TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD 1869 – One of the greatest American technological feats of the 19th century was the building of the transcontinental railroad. The railroad crossed southern Wyoming to take advantage of the low grade and to stay close to coal deposits it relied on for fuel.  LINCOLN HIGHWAY 1913 – The Lincoln Highway was the first roadway to span the continent. Publications, like the 1913 Lincoln Highway Guide, helped travelers traverse the 3,000 miles between New York City and San Francisco. The highway became US 30 within Wyoming in 1928 and evolved into I-80 during the 1960s and 1970s.
